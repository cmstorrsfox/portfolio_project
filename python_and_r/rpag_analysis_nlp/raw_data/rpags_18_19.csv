Pink,"Feddrov seems to struggle to keep up with what we are studying in class. He needs to improve all his skills (reading, writing, speaking and listening). It is important that he puts in lots of time outside of class to build up his speed at comprehending information and communicating his ideas. It is strongly advised he join both listening and writing workshops."
Green,
Red,"I am very uncertain over Fedrov's English ability and capacity for understanding the course. He seems to have a lot of difficulty in understanding the concepts and ideas we examine, and each time I have asked him questions during class he has been unable to answer. His homework was a simple copy-paste from the slides, without any proof of extra reading or research on the subject.  
He has to understand that he will have to put a lot of work if he is to pass the course and much more effort if he is to progress.
I would advice him to attend as many Workshops as possible, not only Psychology but for English language skills as well. In addition, he has to make a glossary of concepts we examine, if he has not started writing one."
Red,I am really concerned with Fedrov's ability to follow and understand the course. I have already shared my concerns with him and we have agreed that he will be doing extra work for both Sociology and Psychology. He will be also attending the Workshops after Reading Week.
Red,"Your average exam score is concerningly low. You need to try harder to communicate in English in class and let me know when you need help understanding. You will need to attend the listening and writing workshops next term as well as regularly practise your reading, writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Amber,Chenye works well in classes and has a good understanding of the subject. He needs more self-study to progress and achieves his goal.
Amber,"You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. Try to speak more in class. You should start building your vocabulary; have you started what I advised you of (a vocabulary list)?Your formative showed that you have some ability and understanding of what we are covering but you have to improve. I hope you have understood what we mean by critical analysis and the examples I have used for this. You are supposed to write academically, using evidence to support your argument. And you have been shown how to do that.You should continue to attend workshops."
Amber,Your formative assignment was okay but you will need to improve on the summative to attain a progression mark. You do have the ability to improve on that but what is required of you is concentration skills and commitment.You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. Your overall English skills need to improve but I can see you are putting some effort towards that direction.
Pink,"You have been a satisfactory student in class and have sometimes tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening, reading and writing exams results are concerningly low. You need to attend the listening and writing workshops as well as regularly practice your writing, reading and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle for example the listening videos with questions or TED talks for note-taking skills and strategies. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."

Pink,"Fedrov needs to contribute more in class and always be prepared. His writing, reading and listening grades all need to improve to ensure progression to his next chosen course. To achieve this he should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up his writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books."
Amber,He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week to progress and achieves his goal.
Amber,"Feddrov has been in the range of 60 since the beginning of the year. I have already communicated to him my concerns about his Progression at RH and he has had a meeting with Simone where she will try to find some other Psychology programs to accomodate him. While not impossible, I do believe he will find it difficult in the Psychology Department at RH."
Pink,"Feddrov is trying hard but he is kind of finding it difficult to adjust to expectations of University studying. He missed his deadline for Summative 1 because he thought it was for a different month. His spoken English is not improving despite all my efforts (asked him to keep a list of words, to always ask for things he does not understand, etc.) and he seems a bit overwhelmed. He Formative 2 was really poor as well. I do not want to dissapoint him but I believe he will have a lot of difficulty in progressing, especially since his Degree is Psychology which is quite a difficult one to progress to."

Pink,"Humnah moved to this pathway recently, and I think she needs to work hard to reach her goal by attending all the classes and completing all the tasks and homework that she has missed."
Red,"I have a concern about Humnah's progress after she changed her pathway she hasn't attended any Physics classes or the lab sessions. I do not know how she will manage to catch up on all the topics and the lab experiments that she has missed. She needs to be more responsible by attending all the classes in the future. Also, I suggest she arranges catch up classes with me and shows a proactive interest in doing so."
Red,I did not see this student in my class yet.
Green,"Humnah's positive attitude to learning and the respect she consistently shows both to her tutors and her classmates make her a real pleasure to teach. Her formative AES assessment results indicate she has a firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and is more than capable of putting them into practice. Provided she continues working hard next term, I expect Humnah's summative results to be of equally high standard. During the Winter Break, Humnah should start working on the AES research project so that she can get started on CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Amber,Humnah has a good understanding and participates well during classes. Should do well and progress to achieve her goal if she continues at this current level.
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Humnah jointed the class later and was working well during the first few classes. Then she stopped attending regularly. She never submitted any homework and did not attend the recommended Maths Workshop either. This resulted in very poor performance in her test. To improve the situation, she needs to work regularly in classes and at home, submit her homework for marking, and attend Maths workshops. Hopefully this will improve the situation."

Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative assessment. 
Humnah attendance is not satisfactory. She knows some topics, but she is not trying to learn new elements and she is often distracted in class. This resulted in her poor test result. She should start to study properly before it is too late: pay attention in classes; attend Maths workshop, regularly submit the homework."
Green,"Humnah is a very intelligent and capable student. This term, however, she has missed a significant number of AES classes which resulted in lower class participation and, I feel, has taken some toll on her writing skills, as despite being a 
good writer, she tends to struggle with ensuring her work meets appropriate academic conventions. In Term 3, Humnah needs to take greater responsibility for her studies and ensure she attends all classes. Should she miss any lessons for unavoidable health-related reasons, it is imperative she gets in touch with her tutor and catches up on all work she has missed. During the Spring Break she should work on her CW3 and use her AES book and Moodle page to revise all material taught in Term 2 paying particular attention to argumentation and academic style."
Amber,She needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think she is putting in the required effort for the course. She should do a self-study every week.
Green,She works well in classes and has a good understanding of the subject. She needs more self-study to progress and achieves her goal.
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative and second formative assessments.
Humnah is often late, she missed some classes as well. Her results for the resit of the first summative test and second formative assessment were good, but she needs to attend regularly, continue to work in class and in home in order to achieve the required high marks in the final examination."

Red,This student has not attended a single class I ran.
Green,
Amber,"Alainah is a bright and capable student who, when focused, makes valuable contributions to AES classes. Having said that, she gets easily distracted by her fellow classmates, which frequently impacts her ability to fully understand and internalise concepts introduced in class. This is reflected in her formative AES Term 1 results, which show her writing skills to be below the level required for progression to her chosen degree at Royal Holloway. It is therefore very important that Alainah dedicates some time during her winter break to revising principles of academic writing style and attends writing workshops when they re-commence in Term 2."
Green,"Your work this term has no doubt been impacted by your attendance. However, you are capable of good work, including accurate and insightful interpretation of the texts that we are studying. It would be good to hear more from you and see you focusing more on the matters at hand rather than carrying on your own conversations at the back of the room, which happens all too frequently. You do work well in groups when you stay on track with the relevant task, but you have a capacity to get sidetracked, so next term please focus on your attitude, making sure that you prepare for classes and take an active and constructive part in them. Your formative assignment was good, but showed possibilities for development which we will discuss at your tutorial."
Pink,"Alainah's progress has been very slow. She missed many classes and this was reflected in the quality of her formative essay and her class contributions. To catch up with the rest of the class, she would need to devote more time to independent study and wider reading."
Green,"You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. 
Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this.
You have the capabilities for much higher marks. A bit more commitment can do wonders in your case."
Amber,

Pink,Alainah missed all classes since the beginning of December 2018. At this point she is unlikely to reach a progression grade for global politics
Green,
Green,"Alainah is a very intelligent and capable student. This term, however, she has missed a significant number of AES classes which seems to have taken a toll on her performance in summative coursework 1, which showed work well below Nur’s capabilities. Alainah is a good writer but, perhaps due to the number of classes she has missed, she tends to struggle with ensuring her work meets appropriate academic conventions as is well-structured. In Term 3, Alainah needs to take greater responsibility for her studies and ensure she meets all her deadlines and attends all classes. Should she miss any lessons for unavoidable health-related reasons, it is imperative she gets in touch with her tutor and catches up on all work she has missed. During the Spring Break Alainah should work on her CW3 and use her AES book and Moodle page to revise all material taught in Term 2 paying particular attention to argumentation and academic style."
Amber,"You have potential in Arts. However, your attendance is becoming problematic for your progress, because you have missed so much of the course content. Moreover, you did not submit a formative assignment, so I cannot gauge your progress. You also do not have that set of feedback to help you prepare for your summative assignment. In order for you to progress, you need to start ensuring that you are obtaining the most benefit from your classes as possible. You can do this by reading the texts and engaging with class discussion, as well as preparing thoroughly for lessons. It is not too late for you to do well in Arts, but you need to start working hard."
Amber,"Alainah clearly showed with the Formative Assessment 2 good knowledge of Global Politics and good research skills. Unfortunately, the grade for the Summative Assessment 1 is low and does not reflect her abilities. The main reason remains the high number of missed classes."
Pink,"While with a very good level of English and critical thinking, her actual determination and passion for studying at the IFY has been non-existent. I have seen her only half the times we have class. It is a pitty that she might not progress due to poor attendance."

Amber,
Pink,Xin is not participating actively in class and is unable to answer questions when asked. I am concerned about his level of english and he now needs to develop his language skills urgently.
Amber,
Pink,"Overall, Xin is a good student but is easily distracted by his peers. At this point in the course it is difficult to know how much he is absorbing of the class content, though one thing is clear, he needs to concentrate more in class overall. In order for him to progress I would recommend he attends one Management and Economics workshop a week until the end of term."
Red,"Your exams results, apart from speaking, are concerningly low. You need to try harder to communicate in English in class and let me know when you need help understanding. You will need to attend the listening and writing workshops next term as well as regularly practice your reading, writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Pink,"Xin is not engaging with classes very well. He does not engage in class discussions and is unable to answer questions when asked. Having said that, his formative result was very encouraging so I am hopeful that this trend will continue. He needs to continue to work on his English and to develop his knowledge through reading the textbook/Moodle."
Red,"I am really concerned about Xin. His attendance has been quite patchy and his understanding is very shaky. I am concerned that he will not progress at this rate. Attendance of all workshops is vital. I would advise Xin to also arrange a few personal tutorials with me, so we put in place a learning plan for him in his personal time."
Amber,"Li Xin is mostly engaged in class, although he tends to remain quiet in group discussions. While he shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term, he has not achieved his full potential achieving 56% in his first formal formative assessment. While this is a fair score for this first term, I would like to see him do much better in his summative assessment next year. To achieve this, he needs to attend a few workshops as this will aid his progress."
Pink,"You have been a satisfactory student in class and have sometimes tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening, reading and writing exams results are concerningly low. You need to attend the listening and writing workshops as well as regularly practice your writing, reading and listening skills outside of class.

Amber,
Red,Xin is underperforming in class. He must attend workshops more regularly and he should self-study to progress this year
Amber,
Pink,"Xin needs to contribute more in class. He needs to keep focused and always be prepared. His reading, writing, speaking and listening grades all need to improve to ensure progression. To achieve this he should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up his writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. For speaking, he needs to speak in English inside and outside of class as much as possible. He should try to make more friends who speak other languages."
Pink,Xin is not committed enough to his studies. He does not get involved with class discussions and is unable to answer questions when asked. His challenge now is that he both needs to focus on his language skills and his studies in business.
Pink,He is very quiet in class. He needs to work hard to progress this year. I would advise him to arrange a few personal tutorials with me to place  a learning plan in his own time
Pink,"Xin Li - you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to improve your listening writing skills, as well as work on your accounting. I recommend you attend workshop classes after Easter."

Pink,Leo appears to be a capable student but has not shown much willingness to work hard and try to develop his AES skills. As such I have seen very little work from him. He needs to improve his attitude and would probably benefit from attending listening and writing workshops. He needs to participate in class activities more in order to maximise his chances of progression.

Pink,Yongqi is very quiet in class and does not contribute to class discussions. When asked questions he is unable to answer. Yongqi did not submit a formative assessment so this means that it is not clear if he is developing at all.His English skills appear to need development and he must now focus on improving his English and confirming the first term of learning by reading the book/Moodle.
Red,"I am really concerned about Xin. His attendance has been quite patchy and his understanding is very shaky. I am concerned that he will not progress at this rate. Attendance of all workshops is vital. I would advise Xin to also arrange a few personal tutorials with me, so we put in place a learning plan for him in his personal time."
Pink,"Leo participates in class only when asked direct questions and this is a measure of his engagement in Economics. It is also reflected in his poor score for his first formal formative assessment (34 %), which is well below the IFY pass mark. One factor which is holding him back is his poor attendance. This is something he must change urgently in the new year if he is to progress on to his chosen degree. Leo should also ensure he completes all tasks on time and to the best of his ability. I hope he will do much better in his summative assessment, as he was given clear instructions and advice through personal tutorial that were offered to all students."
Pink,You need to put more effort into your AES class. You especially need to focus on improving your listening and reading skills. You also failed to attend your summative seminar speaking exam. It is strongly recommended you attend the listening workshops. You need to put more effort into paying attention in class and participating in the activities. Without a greater effort there is a good chance you will not achieve the marks you need to progress on to your chosen course.
Pink,Yonqi did not submit a summative assessment. He lacks engagement in class and is unable to answer questions. He must now commit to improving his English urgently or he risks failing the course.
Red,"Yongqi should attend all workshops as his performance not good, and he needs to work hard to progress this year. I would advise him to arrange a few personal tutorials with me to place a learning plan for him in his own time"
Pink,"Leo missed many class so low with  attendance ,low performance, has not submitted his summative assessment work, need to concentrate and make optimum effort to progress."
Pink,"Leo needs to contribute more in class. He is often not paying enough attention to be able to take part in discussions. He sometimes shows he is capable of doing very well, but he needs to be more consistent and diligent. His reading, writing and listening skills all need to be improved to meet progression requirements. I suggest he use the grammar book to build up your writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. He should also attend listening and writing workshops."
Pink,"Yongqi is not committed to his studies. He does not get involved in class, he does not take notes and he spends most of his time looking at his phone. He is unable to answer direct questions when asked. I am very concerned that he will not be able to complete the course."

In class, she is engaged, focused and has shown a good level of understanding.  I strongly believe she is capable of scoring highly to ensure successful progression. She has the potential to do very well, but she needs to ensure that she reviews and applies the skills taught in her work. During winter break I strongly advise her to complete all AES reading exam practice tasks and 2 essays and in term 2 make use of the AES drop-in clinic to further support her English studies."

Her summative listening grade was disappointing and so she should make sure she follows instructions fully, and although her speaking grade was good, it could be better. Nesini has been making an effort with her writing, but the aspect that she struggles with most at the moment is paraphrasing and idea that you should not lift all evidence from the text. She should complete some reading and writing skills exercises by using the exam practice booklets in the appendices section of the AES workbook."

Amber,"While Gustavo scored very well in his formative AES exams, his participation in class this term left a lot to be desired. He missed many of his classes and rarely made the effort to go through the material missed or check what homework was set for the next day. As a result, he may struggle to complete his summative coursework as - unlike the exams - it is knowledge- rather than skill-based. It is thus imperative that Gustavo dedicates some time during his winter break to AES Term 1 revision and ensures he understands all concepts taught in term 1 before the course resumes in January."
Green,"Gustavo is a very talented student. His formative result was a little disappointing, but this is probably more indicative of his lack of experience of preparing work in this style. He has excellent English and is very engaged with classes. He often participates in class discussions, asks questions and is eager to answer questions when asked.I expect Gustavo to do very well on the course."
Red,"Gustavo needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week. He is willing to learn, but I think he should attend Maths workshop"
Green,"Gustavo is a studious and attentive student. He listens carefully in class and focuses well when working independently or as part of a group. I advise him  to continue to build on his confidence and contribute more regularly in class, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills, giving him the opportunity to shape his own thinking in relation to that of others. Gustavo has achieved 70% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a very good grade. I do feel however, that there is even more potential in Gustavo and that he can do even better in future assessments, as I explained to him in his one to one tutorial with me. Nonetheless, so far so good. Keep up the good work Gustavo!"

In Term 3, Gustavo needs to take greater responsibility for his studies and ensure he meets all his deadlines and attends all classes.

During the Spring Break he should work on his CW3 and use his AES book and Moodle page to revise all material taught in Term 2 paying particular attention to argumentation and academic style."
Green,Gustavo is a very good student and is fully involved in all classes. The only risk is that at times he can procrastinate and avoid follow up work which might let him down. If he can master organising himself he has the talent to have a successful university career.
Pink,"He is working hard in class, but he is not progressing in the exam. He must attend workshops more regularly in order to progress. I advise him to work harder in his spare time and to speak with me regularly if he is struggling to understand the work"
Pink,"Gustavo - at times you demonstrate a good uptake of knowledge of this subject. I am pleased to see that during class you do answer questions and your confidence in class is very good. Please now try and improve your accounting skills as this let you down in our recent formative assessment. Please attend my workshop classes after Easter as the grade you received was far too low for a student such as yourself. You have the potential to do well and progress, but must work hard in the areas you are weakest in."

A particular area to pay attention to is his academic writing; he already writes well, but needs to focus on applying the writing skills taught in class to improving his academic style to ensure he achieves the best grade possible. His reading is not reflective of his capability and I hope to see an improve next term. During winter break he should work on completing all AES reading exam practices."
Green,"Prithvi is a very good student. He gets fully involved in classes, takes notes and is always open to answering questions when they are posed. His formative result was very good and he should do very well on this course."

By practising and applying the written skills taught in class as I am sure he'll go on to do well. R&W practice exercises can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and he could also make use of the AES drop-in clinics for additional writing support."

Amber,He did quite well in his resit assessment. He needs to work hard to progress this year. I would advise him to arrange a few personal tutorials with me to place a learning plan in her own time
Green,"Prithvi - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."
Green,Comments remain the same as for RPAG4.

Pink,"I believe that Cloud is putting some effort in the course. He needs to however be more active and try to talk and write in English and in subject specific vocabulary as much as possible. A good idea would be to attend workshops, both for Psychology and English language, as well as create a glossary of concepts we examine (if he has not yet done so, as I have asked them to do so) and make sure he is able to define all of them."
Red,"Your exams results, apart from speaking, are concerningly low. You need to try harder to communicate in English in class and let me know when you need help understanding. You will need to attend the listening and writing workshops next term as well as regularly practise your reading, writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Amber,"Yunshan is a good student and takes his studies seriously. Unfortunately although his English is improving it is still holding him back from joining in class discussions - which he does attempt to do. His result in the formative was not good, but shows some progress and based on the feedback I would expect him to do better in the summative."
Pink,Yunshan needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week. He needs to be interactive during classes; he needs to attend Core Maths workshops
Amber,"You have a problem with your attention in class as, often when I ask you questions, you seem to not be following me. I often have to repeat a subject and question twice to you. If you do not understand something, please ask me during class.

You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. 

Your formative showed that you have some ability and understanding of what we are covering but you have to improve. 

I hope you have understood what we mean by critical analysis and the examples I have used for this. You are supposed to write academically, using evidence to support your argument. And you have been shown how to do that.

You should continue to attend workshops."
Pink,You have shown some good speaking skills and have tried hard to participate in class. You sometimes complete homework and try hard to understand. You need to work on improving your other skills particularly your writing. I strongly advise attending the writing workshop next term as well as regularly practising your listening and reading skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book.

Amber,"Cloud is a keen and attentive member of the class. He contributes well and asks when he needs help. Generally, he is doing fine, but his writing marks in particular need improvement. To achieve this he should use the grammar book more often, write more practice essays using the practice exam questions and read more academic texts."
Amber,"Yunshan is a very positive influence in class and is interested and involved. However, his language skills seem to hold him back. If his language skills improved I think that Yunshan might be quite a good student, as things stand if he continues to work he should be successful on the course."
Amber,He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week to progress and achieves his goal.
Amber,"Cloud will manage to pass and progress in Psychology. He has showed dedication and ability to actually comprehend the subjects we have been discussing throughout the year. Although Psychology is not his favourite subject, he seems to be able to comprehend everything we discuss.
I do believe he will need to improve a bit in his spoken language to do well next year as an Undergraduate."

Pink,"I am concerned about Tianhao's level of understanding in class. There are times when other students need to explain the tasks to him. He does not participate in class discussions and finds it difficult to answer questions. Tianhao needs to really work on his language skills by immersing himself in the language at all times, for example watching english language films/tv."
Pink,"Hu Tianhao- Kevin is a good student but a little too quiet in class. At this point in the course, it is difficult to know his level of understanding of Economics. One factor contributing to this is his reluctance to answer questions in class, which makes it difficult to gauge how much he has fully understood. In order for him to progress I would recommend he attends one Management and Economics workshop a week until the end of term."
Pink,"Although I had great concerns about Tianhao, I have discussed with Philippa which has assured me that his level of English understanding is not as low as I thought. Since then, I have asked him questions during class and he was able to answer them, albeit with a limited vocabulary. I do believe that he will be able to pass but he will need to put some effort for progressing."
Red,"You have been a good student in class and have tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening, writing and reading exam results are concerning. You must attend the listening workshop next term and regularly practise your reading, writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle; for example, completing the listening videos with questions can help you prepare for Part 2 of the AES exam. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Amber,"Tianhao has begun to make a more positive contribution and concentrate more in class. At first his English seemed to be holding him back, but this now appears to be improving. His formative result was low and this definitely needs to be worked on taking the feedback into consideration. Tianhao needs to spend more time reading the textbook to ensure that he has a good understanding of the topics in class."
Amber,"I am very pleased with Kevin's attitude and he is showing good progress in class. One area for Kevin to push harder in is in contributing to class discussions. nonetheless, he is trying to focus more on the content that is being delivered and starting to show some understanding of the concepts introduced thus far in this term. Kevin has achieved 53% in his first formal formative assessment, which is below the score required for progression and so must try harder in achieving a higher grade in his summative assessments after the Christmas break. To do this, he should consider carefully the written feedback given to him and the feedback I gave him in our one-to-one tutorial. Also, currently, he is not attending workshops regularly and must do so in the new year. I am sure he has the potential to work hard and continue to make progress."
Amber,Your formative assignment was okay but you will need to improve on the summative to attain a progression mark. You do have the ability to improve on that but what is required of you is concentration skills and commitment.You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. Your overall English skills need to improve but I can see you are putting some effort towards that direction.
Pink,"You sometimes try hard to participate in class and have shown a good range of vocabulary, but you need to make sure you contribute more consistently. Your listening exam score is concerningly low. You need to work hard to improve this. You must attend the listening workshop. There are many recommendations for how to practice listening on Moodle for example the listening videos with questions or TED talks for note-taking skills and strategies. Also, make sure you complete homework regularly. Also, make sure you speak in English as much as possible both in and outside of class."
Pink,"Tianhao shows some green shoots of ability in the topic, but his language skills hold him back. He is under investigation for summative 1."
Amber,
Pink,"You need to show some more focus in class. You are often distracted, not paying attention either during the lecture or the seminars. You already know that your Sociology is heavy in terms of vocabulary and it will require some more effort on your side. I expect to see more determination on your part if you wish to improve your mark and progress."
Pink,"Kevin is generally a keen and attentive member of the class. He contributes well and asks when he needs help. His writing, reading and listening grades all need to improve to ensure progression to his next chosen course. To achieve this he should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up his writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books."
Pink,"Tianhao has spurts of motivation, but too often falls back into talking with his friends. He continues to have language difficulties that hold him back - especially as topics covered are now getting more complex. Tianhao needs to maintain his focus if he is going to pass."
Pink,"Kevin - you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to improve your listening writing skills, as well as work on your accounting. I recommend you attend workshop classes after Easter."
Pink,"I have many worries over the progression of Mr. Hu. His English have somewhat progressed but he is still very far behind that level where he could be guaranteed a progression mark. He has not shown the adequate determination towards studying Sociology (apart perhaps from the first term). His attention and effort have gone down during Term 2. Unless he puts much much more effort into studying, he will not be able to attain a progression mark for Sociology. 
A lot of independent study is required by him. 
His Resit was in the range of 50."

Green,"Well done on your work this term! You have shown a good, conscientious attitude and make an effort both to participate in class and small groups. You should focus on preparing to make sure you get the most out of lessons and try to participate more in lectures - where you go silent! Your group work is very good. You did well in the formative assignment, which gives you a strong basis for the summative assignment - so well done. Overall, you should be pleased with your work this term and you have plenty to build on for next term, so well done."
Green,"Alina is a quite and thoughtful student who, nevertheless is a valued member of the seminar group. Although not always the first to contribute Alina invariably knows the subject and with a little more self-confidence she will develop further skills and knowledge. For her first formative essay, Alina chose to write about whether or not globalisation is a threat to sovereignty. It was a good and interesting essay, which showed great promise for the future. Alina has a good knowledge and understanding of key aspects of this course but will need to work hard at a few aspects of her studies e.g. referencing and bibliographical work and at the very least, refer to all the books in the reading list. It is important that all students refer to the suggested or recommended texts and use this as the basis for all essays. Alina's written English is fluent and interesting with few mistakes. As her spoken English and confidence grows I am sure she will go on to achieve higher grades in future."
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. 
I do not have a formative mark on which to comment on. Nevertheless, I believe you will have no problem in progressing."

Amber,"You work very hard in arts and you participate in class, which is good to hear and see as it helps you develop your work. Your formative assignment was a good basis to build on, but going forward you can improve that mark with the feedback. You should continue to participate fully in group work and class work and to read the texts carefully. Doing this and engaging with secondary literature around the texts means that you will be able to write a good essay for your summative assignment."
Green,"Alina continues to work hard and is making good progress. Although quitter in seminars, Alina contributes well and is an asset to the group."
Green,"While Alina's Formative 2 result was not good, I believe she most definitely has the capacities for a progression mark. She is a smart and bright young lady, very responsible and I believe knows what to do to attain a progression mark. I have no particular worries that she will be able to do so."

Pink,"Siraj engages really well when he is in class and is clearly an able student.  A further increase in participation in AES classes in the weeks to come may help Siraj to fully accomplish his potential, particularly in relation to the requirement to produce a lengthy and well-structured written text.  To ensure that any AES knowledge gaps are filled, I would recommend reviewing the first few weeks' lesson slides on Moodle and raising any related questions in drop-in sessions."
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,"Siraj does not have a good background knowledge in mathematics and finds the work in this class difficult. He is quiet, but he clearly needs extra help with more basic mathematics. I recommend to put more effort into doing homework regularly. If he works regularly in class and at home, it should improve the situation."
Amber,"Siraj achieved a commendable result in his formative seminar assessment and this ability to engage actively and intelligently in discussion is always evident in AES class time.  In order to consolidate the AES skills taught in classes this term, it may be helpful to review all Term 1 material in the workbook and to utilise the independent study materials on Moodle.  Attendance at writing workshops in Term 2 should help further develop academic writing skills, in particular text structuring and referencing."
Amber,Siraj needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week.
Amber,Siraj did quite well in his first assessment. He needs more self-study to progress and achieves his goal.
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Siraj test result is extremely low. He was attending regularly the extra recovery class orginised for him and two other students. Siraj seems to understand the questions we did in recovery class, but he does not memorise the rules and technique well enough and could not keep up with work in regular class. I am afraid that without extra tuition Siraj will not be able to achieve reasonable results."
Pink,"Siraj is making some progress in AES and is able to express himself in a way which is very articulate.  His writing, however, needs considerable development and I would strongly recommend that he attends writing workshops and revises the AES lesson input from Term 1 which particularly focussed on how to structure academic texts.   Whilst his first summative listening result was reasonable (56%), this grade might also be improved in the second summative exam, if Siraj works through the listening materials for use in independent study time which are on the AES Moodle page."
Amber,
Green,
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative assessment. 
Siraj attendance is good, he also attends Maths workshop. Unfortunately his test result is extremely low. Due to his very week background in basics of mathematics,Siraj could not keep up with the work we are doing in class.Even if he understands the topic, he does not memorise the rules and techniques and could not repeat them next time or during the test. I am afraid that without extra tuition Siraj will not be able to achieve reasonable results."
Amber,"Siraj achieved a good result in the summative seminar assessment at the beginning of Term 2.  Although he passed the listening exam, there is some scope for improvement the grade achieved.  In order to develop listening, reading and writing skills in coming weeks, and to gain higher results in summative assessments in Term 3, it may be helpful to review the independent study material which is available on Moodle, and to work through all of the practice exam material in the back of the AES Workbooks."
Amber,He works well in classes and has a good understanding of the subject. He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work to progress and achieves his goal.
Green,He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week to progress and achieves his goal.
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative and second formative assessments.
Siraj was working very hard before the resit of his first summative test and his result reflects that (60%), but he did not attend at all last week. He needs to continue to work hard, attend all classes and Maths workshop, Unfortunately his understanding of basic mathematics is so poor, that it could be very difficult for him to achieve the required 65%. I strongly recommend him to get extra help during the Easter holiday and try to improve his mathematical skills."

He never submitted the recommended homework, which means he does not practice between the classes. If he starts working regularly in class and at home, it should improve the situation."
Green,"Arbaaz has demonstrated a great attitude in AES classes; he engages well in both independent tasks and peer group work.  Arbaaz’s seminar discussion result was exceptionally good and was indicative of his active and intelligent attitude to contributing to classes as a whole.  Reading and writing assessment results, however, highlight significant potential for development.  It may be beneficial for Arbaaz to attend writing workshops next term, to work on paraphrasing and citation skills, and to complete the reading exam practice texts in the back of the AES workbook to develop reading skills and gain experience in answering exam style questions."
Amber,Arbaaz needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week. He needs to be interactive during classes
Green,Has a good understanding and achieved a good formative assessment mark. Should reach progression if he continues working at his current level.
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Arbaaz's Maths level is not very good, but he has shown some improvement after he attended one or two classes with three fellow students and this was reflected in his test results which are practically at the same level as the rest of the class. Unfortunately, he stopped attending and missed a lot of new material which could be catastrophic for him. If he wants to progress, he needs to resume the work during the classes; practice regularly at home and attend all available Maths workshops."
Green,
Amber,
Green,
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative assessment. Arbaaz's is working regularly and he attends the Maths workshop. There is some positive dynamics, but it is still not enough to pass the course taking into account his week background in mathematics. To improve the situation he should continue his work in classes, but also start to work between the classes: do the homework, correct the mistakes and memorise the rules."
Green,Arbaaz has achieved excellent results in speaking and listening assessments this term.  He is a hardworking and attentive student and has shown some good progress in developing his academic writing style in recent weeks.  Arbaaz makes valuable contributions to class discussions.  It may be helpful for Arbaaz to practise planning and writing essays under timed conditions in order to prepare effectively for future assessments; practice material can be found in the back of the AES Term 2 Workbook and on Moodle.
Amber,He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He needs more self-study to progress and achieves his goal.

Green,"Overall, Omar has shown very good language skills and has the potential to do very well in AES. However, he sometimes loses focus and becomes distracted by his classmates. He must also try to apply the academic skills taught in class in his written work and refer to my class slides on MOODLE as reference to ensure that he fulfils his potential and reach progression."
Green,"Omar is one of my outstanding students in Applied Maths. He is doing all the exercises correctly and accurately, and I hope he will stay at this level to reach his future goal."
Amber,"Omar is a good student who is willing to learn and participate actively in class, but he needs to pay attention to do his homework and especially the lab reports."
Pink,"Omar finds the work in this class difficult, he needs extra help with more basic mathematics. He is also easily distracted during the classes. I recommend to put more effort into doing homework regularly and be more attentive in class."
Pink,"This term Omar has missed a number of AES classes; when present he can be easily distracted and becomes less focused. His formative grades generally show that his listening and speaking are his stronger skills, but he needs to dedicate a sufficient amount of time to improving his academic reading and writing style. During winter break I strongly advise him to complete all AES reading practice exams and 2 essays and writing workshops to help support his English studies and in term 2 I hope to see an overall improvement in engagement."
Green,Omar works well in class and has a good understanding of the subject. Please keep this up.
Amber,"Omar works hard in the lab; however, the formative assessment mark should be higher than achieved. He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work to improve his writing skills."
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. I am extremely worried about Omar. His test result is extremely low, and he missed the opportunity to do some recovery work provided by the centre which organised extra classes for him and two other students. He missed many regular classes as well. He is also easily distracted during the classes. He could not keep up with work in regular class and does not memorise the rules and techniques. I am afraid that without extra tuition Omar will not be able to achieve reasonable results."
Pink,"Omar is a very capable student, but clearly needs to invest more time in his English studies. He needs to have more self-discipline and take steps to firstly improve his attendance and pay attention and focus in class. By not doing so is affecting his chances of progression. His summative speaking and listening have been less pleasing and do not reflect his overall ability. He also needs to start dedicating a sufficient amount of time to CW1 and improving his reading and writing skills which are his weaker skills."
Green,
Amber,"Omar is engaging actively in the class and especially in the lab. He is willing to learn, but I am not satisfied with his attendance this term and the progress in the assessments."
Red,These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative assessment. I can only repeat that I am extremely worried about Omar. He missed a lot of classes. His test result is extremely low. He could not keep up with work in regular class and does not memorise the rules and techniques. I am afraid that without extra tuition Omar will not be able to achieve reasonable results.
Amber,"Omar is a very capable student and has shown some very promising changes in his attitude towards English in the second part of the term. His results for his summatives were reasonable, but I feel that there is much more room for improvement and he has yet to fully demonstrate this. He needs to really focus on his reading and academic writing skills as these are areas that need more attention.There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook."

Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative and second formative assessments.
Omar attendance and work in class is better than before. He was working particularly hard before the resit of his first summative test and his result reflects that (57%). If he continues his good work, does his homework, attends all classes and Maths workshop, his end results could be reasonable. Unfortunately his understanding of basic mathematics is so poor, that it could not be enough to achieve the required 65%. I strongly recommend him to get extra help during the Easter holiday and try to improve his mathematical skills."
Amber,"Omar has continued to make some promising changes and has become more focused on his AES studies. However, one key area Omar should try to work on in future is asking questions regarding assignments and any other given tasks that he is required to undertake to ensure that he stays on task. He should also keep practising his reading and writing skills as well as making a conscientious effort to improve his research skills as this will serve him well in his academic career."
Green,Omar worked hard to prepare for the poster presentation assessment. He presented his poster very well.
Amber,Omar works hard in class; the formative assessment mark was good. He needs to pay more attention and study hard to achieve his goal
Red,"Unfortunately Omar did not listen to my advise (see RPAG 4) and did not do any recovery work during the Easter holiday. His attendance of the classes and extra workshop is not very good. 
His understanding of basic mathematics is very poor, he doesn't memorise rules and doesn't practice at home. I am extremely worried about his performance during the final exam."

Pink,"I am a little concerned with Ozgur's class performance so far. Even though he has demonstrated a basic understanding of the activities, it is not yet clear whether he fully understands the tasks. He needs to ask more questions and seek my help after classes. Alternatively, there are drop-in AES sessions as well as workshops that he could also attend to support his learning."
Pink,"I get the impression that you are finding the classwork very difficult, but don't like to say so. You are very quiet in class and seem to find some of the concepts hard to follow. If you are struggling to understand, please tell me! Trying to take a more active part in group work would also help you, so try that in the next half term."
Amber,
Pink,"I am uncertain of Ozgur's ability to understand the course. He often seems lost during the class and he sometimes even seems unable to locate the kind of discussion we are having. His language skills are not bad, but he needs to start talking and expressing his opinion, being critical of the subjects we discuss. Sociology is about expressing opinion and being critical, so he needs to practise this. Workshop attendance is highly advised."
Pink,"Ozgur possesses a good level of English; however, his formative exam grades and classwork generally show that he needs to work much harder on improving his English learning strategies in order to progress onto his chosen degree. He has the potential to succeed but he first needs to start seeking help from his AES tutor should he feel that he needs the support. In term 2 I hope to see an overall improvement and I also strongly advise him to attend writing and listening workshops to help support his English studies."
Pink,"You have struggled this term to keep up with the module. There are times when this seems to be when you find it too difficult, but there are multiple ways in which you could help yourself. By your own admission, you have not prepared for the lessons in the ways that you should - and as I have explained in the workshops, this is something that you really need to start doing. If you do not prepare the texts, then the lessons will not make any sense - and neither will the workshops which are designed to help you consolidate what you have learnt in class. You should also try and take a more active role in lessons - in groups and also in class discussion. If you try hard, you are capable of this. Your formative assignment mark shows this!"
Amber,Ozgur is an inquisitive and engaged student. He is very active in class and demonstrates clear interest in film. It would be beneficial if he approached his tasks with greater focus and depth of analyses.
Pink,I have to admit that I am not overly confident with your ability to understand the subjects we cover in class. You often seem to drift away and not pay attention in class.I have already made it clear to you that you have to take responsibility for your learning as well. We have asked that you attend workshops and you have done so. But all these efforts and tutorials will be useless unless you commit yourself and understand that you have to also study yourself.
Red,"As we move into the second part of term 2, it has become a concern that Ozgur's engagement in reading and writing tasks in AES has remained low. He rarely completes classroom activities or homework and as a result it is very difficult to provide feedback on his performance and offer him appropriate support. Results so far show that speaking is his strongest skill, but his summative listening score remained exactly the same as his formative. In order to pass the IFY, Ozgur needs to be willing to accept help and act upon the advice given."
Amber,
Green,
Red,"I am not sure Ozgur will manage to progress. Despite all the effort we (both myself and Katie) put in letting him know that he needs to show more determination by himself, he has failed to do so. He constantly tries to find excuses for not studying and not doing the required homework. He does not seem to get that he has to use English sources (his Summative was filled with Turkish sources)."
Red,"Ozgur's summative listening and speaking grades are very much the same as his formative grades in term 1. Although his speaking grade is good, it was felt that he could have achieved even higher if he had been better prepared. His listening grade has been disappointing and he is being supported with listening workshops. I understand that Ozgur finds reading and writing difficult, but I have been unable to help him despite offering because he often does not produce any reading or writing tasks for me to check, so I am unable to provide focused help. It is critical at this point for Ozgur to engage with his reading and writing skills if he is to pass AES."
Pink,"You really struggle in Arts and this is becoming increasingly problematic. Despite being recommended for workshops you have stopped attending and you are not really engaging with the course materials. In order to do better in your second summative assignment, you need to ensure that you start engaging with both the primary texts and some secondary literature. Your formative assignment had some major problems which we will discuss in our tutorial and this should enable you to do better next time. Overall, you need to start engaging more and working harder so that you can score more highly."
Amber,"Vincent is a student who shows some interest in F&M as subject matter. He works well as part of team, but should put greater effort in his classwork and homework"
Pink,"Despite all my efforts to help him, Ozgur seems unable to comprehend that a result reflects the work you put in through studying. He has not studied anything throughout the year, refusing to do so on the basis of ""others do not study either"". I am simply tired of tring to get it to his head.
Despite of all that I speak of above, Ozgur managed to achieve a progression mark in his RESIT."

Pink,"Amos seems to struggle to keep up with what we are studying in class. He needs to improve all his skills (reading, writing, speaking and listening). It is important that he puts in lots of time outside of class to build up his speed at comprehending information and communicating his ideas. It is strongly advised he join both listening and writing workshops."
Pink,Ke does not participate in class discussions and I believe that this is due to his lack of skill in english. He is unable to answer questions clearly when asked in class and he does not appear to be concentrating on the lesson when in class. Ke needs to make a decision about how committed he is to his studies and then act on this.
Amber,
Pink,Amos is really quiet and often distracted during classes. I have concerns about his English language skills as I took the opportunity to talk with him outside the classroom and he has difficulty articulating his thoughts. Workshops are highly advised and should be made mandatory so he can practise language and subject specific vocabulary.
Pink,"You have been a satisfactory student in class and have sometimes tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening and writing exams results are concerningly low. You will need to attend the listening and writing workshops next term as well as regularly practise your writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle (for example, doing the listening videos with questions or listening to TED talks to develop note-taking skills and strategies). You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Pink,"Ke has some challenges in doing well on the course. His English language skills are of some concern and he does not engage with the classes. He must now focus on learning by engaging in class, developing his language skills and reading from the textbook/Moodle."
Amber,Amos is trying to be more attentive in class. His work is also beginning to show some understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Amos has achieved 51% in his first formal formative assessment which is not a true reflection of his ability but of the slow start that he has had. Amos can be a little laid back and I hope the low grade that he received will give him the motivation to achieve his true potential. With a bit more hard work he can make good progress.
Pink,"I have to admit that I am not overly confident with your ability to understand the subjects we cover in class. You often seem to drift away and not pay attention in class, something bad given that your comprehension skills are not the best. We have had private tutorials and workshops and I hope you have understood what is expected of you. You will, however, have to improve attention, concentration in class, workload and commitment if you are to progress."
Amber,
Red,Ke does not appear to be engaged in the classes in any way. He is under investigation for his summative 1.
Red,Amos is not attentive in class.  show some understanding of the concepts but when question raised is unable to answer.  Amos is  laid back and his attitude towards studies is not good at times cannot understand his abilities it is difficult to know as he communicate very little. Need to work very hard.
Red,"I am not confident Amos will be able to progress or even pass. He still is unable to concentrate and he is unable to verbalize any kind of thought he might have. All efforts I have put in to reach to him have failed and workshops were not successful. Lastly, his Summative was a serious case of academic misconduct."
Pink,"Amos needs to contribute more in class. He is often not paying enough attention to be able to take part in discussions. He sometimes shows he is capable of doing very well, but he needs to be more consistent and diligent. His reading, writing and listening skills all need to be improved to meet progression requirements. I suggest he use the grammar book to build up your writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. He should also attend listening and writing workshops."
Pink,"Ke does not appear to engage in the class at all. Even when asked direct questions he is not only unable to answer, but he appears not to understand the question. His most recent resit was a very high quality piece of work. I am still concerned about Ke's capability to pass the course."
Red,"Amos - You need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to attend workshop classes, you missed many of  them last term. To progress you need to do lot of hard work."
Amber,"I have many doubts over his ability to articulate any thoughts. His knowledge of Sociology is very limited, proven also by his Formative result. His Sumamtive was plagiarised throughout. 
Amos has had a problem with his attention and concentration since day 1. He has not managed to improve it, despite consistent comments. We have come to a point where it is too late now.

Despite of my comments above, Amos has managed to secure a 72 in his Resit. To a large extent, however, his in-class behavior has not changed. Perhaps it is an issue of confidence?"

Amber,"Your listening exam score is concerningly low. You need to work hard to improve this. You must attend the listening workshop next term and use the videos with questions on Moodle. There are other recommendations for how to practise listening on Moodle, too. In class you sometimes work hard but you need to be more consistent and make sure you complete homework regularly. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Amber,"Zhenxing is making a genuine effort to learn in class, but does not contribute to class discussions and finds it hard to answer questions when asked. His English has improved, but this needs to improve further if he is going to be able to complete the course successfully. His formative result was acceptable so this gives some foundation for this going forward."
Amber,"Lei tries to be attentive most of the time in class and although he tends to be quiet in class discussions, his work shows that he is grasping the content being delivered. At times, he even shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Lei has achieved 63% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a good result for him for this term. I advise him to build on this success by going carefully over the written and verbal feedback I have given him over the last few weeks."
Pink,I have to admit that I am not overly confident with your ability to understand the subjects we cover in class. You often seem overwhelmed by the details and concepts we talk about in class. If you wish to progress you have to improve on your commitment. Attendance to workshop is highly advisable. Independent reading as well.
Pink,"You sometimes try hard to participate in class and have shown a good range of vocabulary, but you need to make sure you contribute more consistently. Your listening exam score is concerningly low. You need to work hard to improve this. You must attend the listening workshop. There are many recommendations for how to practice listening on Moodle for example the listening videos with questions or TED talks for note-taking skills and strategies. Also, make sure you complete homework regularly. Also, make sure you speak in English as much as possible both in and outside of class."
Amber,
Amber,
Red,I am not sure Jack will manage to pass the course. The subjects we discuss in class seem very difficult for him and he seems unable to follow.
Amber,"Jack often contributes well in class, but generally needs to be more prepared. His listening skills need to be improved to meet progression requirements and he needs to improve his average AES scores. I suggest he use the grammar book to build up his writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. He should also attend listening and writing workshops."
Pink,"Zhenxing does seem to be motivated, but due to his language skills (?) he does not participate in class. He is attentive in class and takes notes, but when asked he is not able to answer questions."
Amber,"Jack - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."
Pink,Jack has put a lot of effort during this term and his mark in the Resit is proof of that effort. He got a 65 which could allow him to progress. He has to however continue with this effort because S2 is more difficult than S1 and he will require a lot of studying for this as well.

Pink,"Guo needs to work harder in class. I am concerned about his progress because he is not engaging in class and the lab, also he is not completing his tasks, homework, and the lab reports on time."
Amber,
Pink,"This term Songyuan has missed a number of AES classes and exams: listening and speaking. He has not yet caught up on the missed class material and his class performance shows a gap in his academic skills knowledge. When in class, he is easily distracted and quickly becomes unfocused. He needs to start taking greater responsibility for his own English language learning and use English as much as possible rather Chinese. In term 2 I hope to see an overall improvement in engagement and I strongly advise him to attend listening and writing workshops to help support his English language learning."
Green,"Songyuan did very well in the formative assessment but he needs to be interactive during classes, he must start speaking and contributing more. He must complete all the exercises from the book"
Pink,"Songyuan needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week. He needs to be interactive during classes, and in the lab, he must start speaking and contributing more."
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Songyuan missed many classes at the beginning of the year but finally started to attend regularly. His Maths level is reasonably good, but the test result was much lower than it should be. He needs to pay more attention during the classes and take notes and do exercises in his notebook. Mathematics is not only about the understanding, but also presenting the work properly and clearly. Another problem is his weak understanding of Maths terminology in English. He should pay extra attention to remembering new terminology and using it during classes. He also should start to do the homework regularly."
Red,"Songguo's attendance has severely affected his English performance. He possesses the skills, but tends to take a less serious attitude to class activities and homework. He needs to invest more time in his English studies and work diligently to ensure he meets his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree. It would be of great benefit if he spoke more English and did research in English and not in Mandarin as I feel this is holding him back. I strongly advise him to work on his reading skills and attend writing and listening workshops to help support his English language skills."
Green,
Pink,He needs to work hard and do more practice by solving the exercises in the class and improve his writing skills to write a lab report.
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative assessment. Songyuan missed many classes. He does'not make any affords in improving his understanding of Maths terminology in English and in learning new topics. The result of the last test was extremely low (partly because he could not understand the questions in English) and he needs to start working immediately, otherwise he could fail the course."
Red,"Songguo needs to dedicate more time to his English studies because his current level of performance is not going to get him the required grades necessary to pass the course. His listening result was disappointing, achieving only 18% and his speaking result would have been better if he took it more seriously and did the preparation. I also strongly advise him to work on his reading and academic writing skills for the practice and build on his vocabulary. There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook."
Amber,He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week.

Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative and second formative assessments.
I am really worried about Songyuan. Only recently he started to attend classes regularly. His knowledge of mathematics is quite good, but he will not be able to achieve good results without understanding the questions and presenting his work properly. He needs to attend all classes including the Maths workshop and work hard to improve his understanding of English mathematical terminology."

Red,"It has been 5 weeks this term and I haven't met this student yet. For this reason, the student has to attend classes from now on and work extra hard to catch up with everything. Apart from attending classes, you need to revise all the previous lessons you missed and attend the writing workshops and drop-in clinics should you need any help."

In class she is engaged and makes good contributions to group discussions. Her formative exams results in general have been very pleasing, although her reading and speaking skills are areas that could be further improved upon. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices to further support her English studies."
Amber,"Raisa appears to be a capable student, but her attendance in the first term has been poor. She does not engage with class discussions, but can answer questions when asked. She did not submit a formative so it is hard to say how she will progress going forward. Her English is good and this will help her to make the most of the course going forward."
Pink,"Raisa demonstrates good understanding and communication skills, and contributes in class discussion when she is present. Her writing skills are fair but need further development. Raisa has scored below 50% in her first formal formative assessment, which is far below the progression requirement for her chosen degree and not a true reflection of her abilities. For Raisa it is her attendance which is holding her back significantly. If she attends classes more regularly, she stands a better chance of progressing"
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. The content of your formative assignment was excellent, despite of losing marks for lateness, etc.You are obviously very able and smart student; be mindful, however, of your attendance level as you have missed quite a few classes and their content."
Amber,
Pink,Raisa has missed a lot of classes. When she is in class she does contribute to the class discussion and appears to have a good understanding. She will now have to commit to her studies if she is going to pass. She did not do summative 1.
Red,"Raisa  is good ,she doesn't make effort in learning, her attendance is low, has not submitted her summative assessment need lot of hard work  to progress."
Red,I am not sure Raisa is interested in the course anymore as she has not taken a Summative while from what I hear from other tutors she wishes to change program.
Red,Raisa - Left the course

Pink,"Wai Chon is a student who is conscientious and engaged. His formative grades generally show that he needs to work more diligently to improve his English language level, particularly in listening, and in order to progress onto his chosen degree, he should remain focused. During winter break he should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and answer 2 essay questions; do some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise him to attend listening and writing workshops to help support his current English language skills."
Amber,"Overall, your work in Arts this term has been good. You are very quiet in the classes, but nonetheless show good understanding of the concepts that we have covered. In the future, you should try and contribute more to class discussion. When you do so, your contributions are accurate and relevant - so it would be beneficial to you and general discussion to hear more from you. Although there were issues with your formative assignment (as we will discuss in your tutorial), the underlying assignment was good, showing that you have progressed this term. You should work harder on preparing for lessons as latterly you have not read the texts. However, there is plenty to be positive about looking ahead to next term."
Amber,"You are clearly working hard in music, so well done. Your formative assignment showed that you understand most of what we are studying and you got a good mark. You are, however, very quiet in class - and you do not participate much in classes. This is something you should aim to change next term: it would be good to hear more from you as you would benefit from challenging yourself in this way. From what your instrumental teacher has said, it sounds as though you are also making good progress on that front, so that is good to hear."
Amber,You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. You should speak much more in class and concentrate during the lecture and seminar. With a bit more commitment you can most definitely achieve a progression mark.
Red,"Wai Chon is engaged when in class, but he needs to invest more time outside his English studies and work diligently to ensure he achieves the best grade possible. He needs to particularly focus on improving his listening as his summative listening result has been disappointing. It would be of great benefit if he spoke more English and did research in English and not in Mandarin as I feel this is holding him back. I strongly advise him to work on his reading skills and attend writing and listening workshops to help support his English language skills."
Pink,"You continue to be very quiet in class, and your summative assignment result was quite low. If you are struggling to understand, then it would be good to hear from you - and perhaps the support of workshops will help. Engaging more thoroughly in classwork and with work outside the classroom would help you considerably."
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,"Wai Chon needs to dedicate more time to improving his overall English level to help him achieve the best possible grade. He needs to continue to work hard and focus on improving his listening as his summative listening result has been disappointing, achieving only 33%. I also strongly advise him to work on his reading and academic writing skills for the practice and build on his vocabulary. There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook."
Pink,"Your work in arts is quite problematic at times. You have not really attended workshops as was recommended for you and you make little effort to contribute in class. Even in group work, you remain reticent. You need to take the time to ensure that you have engaged sufficiently with the text, so that you can participate fully. Please make sure that you attend your workshops - as they are there for your benefit - and try and read the texts. Your second formative assignment shows that you are capable of good work, but you need to stay on track to ensure you improve."
Amber,"You are very quiet in music, meaning that it is hard to gauge your progress or understanding at times. Nonetheless, you give the impression of trying hard to engage with the course and the topics that we are studying, so well done. Your is based on solid foundations which should give you the basis to do well when it comes to your recital - especially as your saxophone teacher reports that you are working well on the practical element of the course, so well done with that. Next term, you need to focus on your written work, as well as participating more in class to ensure success in your final recital."
Pink,"Morgan has had some difficulty with Sociology and the concepts we are discussing. He needs to start attending workshops and start independent study by himself so he is ready for the exam. While capable, he will need a lot of time in revising and reading."

Amber,
Red,I am worried about Kaijun. His attendance is extremely poor and his introductory test result was very low. He should start to attend and work properly before it is too late.
Amber,
Pink,"Kanjo listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. He also contributes, when present, to all class discussions. His listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as his listening score is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course and he failed to attend the writing exam this term. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to guarantee chances of progression."
Pink,"Kaijun has made no impact in the class. He did have some motivation at the beginning of term, but this now seems to be drifting away. His language skills appear to be poor and this is an area that must be developed for him to make the most of the course."
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Kaijun missed a lot of classes and got a very low result in his formative test (17%). He clearly has difficulties with understanding the material. He needs to start work extra hard on his Maths course to avoid the risk of failing. He needs to attend all classes and workshops and do exercises at home."
Amber,"Kaijun -  You seem to be attentive in the class and when questions are asked you demonstrate some knowledge and understanding of the subject. You need to  improve on your confidence though and answer questions without being asked. Additionally, your writing needs to improve too. I see you have the potential to progress, and I recommend you attend the workshop next term."
Amber,
Pink,"Kaijun is not making sufficient progress. His summative 1 score was weak and he is not making any change in his approach in class. He does not participate in class discussions and does not ask questions.

He now needs to take steps to improve his English - this will entail considerable commitment in his own time."
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Kaijin got 34% in the S1 test. Clearly he needs to do more work, be more active in class, ask questions if something is not clear, attend all classes and Maths workshop  regularly  to prepare for the resit of S1 test."
Amber,
Amber,"Kaijun shows a good learning attitude and actively contributes to all class discussions. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. His listening, reading and writing skills, however, need further development.  I'd also advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Attending listening, writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to maximise his chances of progression. He is also advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard."
Pink,"Kaijun had a disappointing result in summative 1 and since then his attendance has got worse. Neither did he complete the work for formative 2. This indicates that he is going to have some difficulty completing the course successfully. Kaijun needs to decide whether he wants to succeed and in particular, make a serious commitment to his studies - this will include reviewing the term 1 materials, making substantial progress in english and participating in classes with enthusiasm."
Red,Kaijun was just below a pass grade in the recent statistics S2 mock test and was absent from the formative 2 exam.  He must practise problem solving and learn the formulae and concepts needed.  Kaijun must take advantage of the support that is available and ask when he needs help.
Amber,"Kaijun - Your attitude is improved in class, but you need to attend my classes more regularly and consistently. Your absences will make it harder for you to successfully pass this subject, and you cannot rely entirely on using resources of Moodle alone to always catch up. You also missed your formative 2 assessment, and this will only make the challenge of progressing to your chosen degree harder. I recommend you attend all workshops and do not miss anymore classes"

Amber,
Pink,Wentao has missed a couple of weeks of classes so I am concerned that he will not be able to catch up. He spends a great deal of time in class talking to his friends and does not seem engaged in the lesson. Whilst he is able to answer questions when asked he does not participate and I have some doubts about his commitment. Wentao needs to decide if he wants to succeed on the course and make a commitment to his studies.
Amber,
Pink,"Shen Wentao- Overall, Davis is a good students showing some knowledge of the subject and is able to articulate himself relatively well and with a degree of confidence. I do feel that he can be easily distracted by his peers, sometimes because he asks students to translate certain things for him or he is doing something similar for others. He is also a little behind because he missed some classes due to his accident and he must make up this work through tutorials or attending workshops in order to secure his progress."
Pink,"Wentao is easily distracted and needs to start taking greater responsibility for his own English language learning and using English as much as possible rather than Chinese. His formative grades generally show that he needs to work harder on improving his level of English, particularly listening, in order to progress onto his chosen degree. During winter break he should work on completing all AES reading practice exams and answer 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise him to attend listening and writing workshops to support his English studies."
Pink,"Wentao has not had good attendance and has not really committed to learning when in class. He is often distracted, does not contribute to class discussions and finds it hard to answer questions when asked. His formative assessment was very poor and he must now commit to his studies or risk failing the whole course. His best course of action is to immerse himself in English language based activities and to read the textbook and Moodle to develop his knowledge."
Pink,Wentao is under performing in class. He must attend workshops more regularly in order to progress. I advise him to work harder in his spare time and to speak with me regularly if he is struggling to understand the work.
Amber,"Davis is an attentive student, though at times he can be distracted. When he does pay attention and contribute to class discussions, he shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far in this term. Davis has achieved 62% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a good score for him for this term. The reason I am giving him an amber is to indicate that he needs to improve his writing skills and attend all classes (as he was absent for couple of class most recently), since he has good potential to do even better than he has already done."
Pink,Wentao is a capable student and has the potential to meet his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree; but in order to do that he needs to invest more effort into his English studies. There has been an overall improvement in his engagement in class as he is trying to focus more and complete tasks to a satisfactory level and it would be of great benefit if he spoke more English and did research in English and not in Mandarin as I feel this is holding him back. I strongly advise him to work on his reading skills and attend writing and listening workshops to help support his English language skills.
Pink,Wentao does not concentrate sufficiently in class and his summative result was very poor. Unless Wentao immediately alters his approach he is at great risk of failing the course.
Red,"Wentao should attend all workshops as his performance not good, and he needs to work hard to progress this year. I would advise him to arrange a few personal tutorials with me to place a learning plan for him in his own time"
Pink,"Davis demonstrates some understanding and has shown some improvement in his communication skills.  but need further development.  which shows he needs to work a little harder to progress, something he can certainly do. I recommend him to attend workshop , as this will increase his chances of progressing."
Pink,"Wentao needs to dedicate more time to improving his overall English level to help him achieve the best possible grade. Similarly this term, he needs to continue to work hard and focus on improving his listening as his summative listening result has been disappointing, achieving only 33%. I also strongly advise him to work on his reading and academic writing skills for the practice and build on his vocabulary. There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook."
Pink,"Wentao has varying levels of motivation, although generally his motivation is low. He does not get involved in class discussion, not least because his language skills are low. When asked a direct question he often cannot answer, but occasionally he will try. I am concerned that Wentao's level of english is not sufficient for him to pass the course."
Pink,He is very quiet in class. He needs to work hard to progress this year. I would advise him to arrange a few personal tutorials with me to place  a learning plan in his own time
Pink,"Davis - you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to improve your listening writing skills, as well as work on your accounting. I recommend you attend workshop classes after Easter."

Amber,
Pink,"Jitao is a positive student, but I am concerned about his level of english language skills. He needs to focus his attention on improving his english. He rarely contributes to class discussions so I am also concerned about how much of the course he is able to understand."
Pink,"Chen Jitao- Paul is a good student and tries hard to understand the subject. At this point in the course, it is difficult to know his full ability but it is clear that his level of language, is a barrier for him. He does try and participate in class by answering questions when raised. I would recommend that he attends one Management and Economics workshop until at least the end of term."
Amber,
Pink,"You have been a good student in class and have tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening and reading exam results are concerning. You must attend the listening workshop next term and regularly practise your reading and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle (for example, doing the listening videos with questions). You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Pink,"Jitao had an acceptable performance in his formative, but he is still unable to engage in class discussions or answer questions when asked. In general it seems that his English language skills are holding him back. Jitao now needs to commit to his studies and in particular develop his language skills and confidence in the language."
Amber,"I am very pleased with Paul's attitude in class. He has made good progress this term. Although he tends to be quiet in class discussions, he is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. Paul has achieved around 60% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a good result for this term. He is attending workshops regularly and trying to question and understand the content that is being delivered to him. I am sure he will continue to make progress with his positive attitude."
Green,"The content of your formative assignment was good but you need to take care of the logistics about it. Be mindful about details such as Reference List, in-text referencing, front page, etc. 
While you do not talk often in class, you seem to be understanding the content of our subject. It would be nice if you could take more initiative in class."
Amber,
Pink,"Jitao does not engage in class and often appears to lack understanding of the course content, however his formative was acceptable and there was some interesting work in his summative albeit suspected of misconduct."
Amber,
Pink,Paul needs just a bit more effort to progress. He is able to to reach a progression mark but needs to put a bit more effort.
Amber,"Paul often contributes well in class, but generally needs to be more prepared. His reading, writing and listening skills all need to be improved to meet progression requirements. I suggest he use the grammar book to build up your writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. He should also attend listening and writing workshops."
Pink,Jitao quite often seems distant in class. He rarely contributes to discussion and is not able to answer questions when directly asked. His language skills are below the standard required (I suspect) so he must now focus on his studies to help get through the last assessments.
Amber,Paul - you need to pay more attention in class and keep up with your work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should do self-study every week  and be more interactive during class. You need to attend the workshop classes; you missed far too many last term.
Red,"Paul is a bit of a riddle. He has lots of difficulty in participating in class and in understanding what the subject of discussion is. His Formative 2 was very low also. Still, he seems to not be realising that he will need a lot of effort to get a passing mark for Sociology. He has to improve his self-discipline in terms of studying, participating and paying attention in class, etc. Otherwise, I am afraid he will not be able to gain a progression mark.
He has not submitted a Resit, despite of paying for it (I believe)."

Amber,
Pink,"Liqun does not participate in class discussions and he is unable to answer specific questions. I am not sure about the cause of this, but I believe that his language skills may be holding him back. He should now put a lot more energy into improving his language skills."
Pink,"Liqun is a good student but perhaps a little too relaxed about his studies. At this point in the course, it is difficult to know his level of understanding of Economics. One factor contributing to this is his reluctance to answer questions in class, which makes it difficult to gauge how much he has fully understood. In order for him to progress I would recommend he attends one Management and Economics workshop a week until the end of term."
Pink,"I am uncertain of Liqun's English skills and ability to understand the course. He rarely speaks in class and whenever I ask him to comment, he seems unable to do so. In fact, he seems unable to even express himself. Workshops attendance should be mandatory for him while he will be asked to start a glossary of all the key concepts we have been discussing until now."
Pink,Your listening exam score is concerningly low. You need to work hard to improve this. You must attend the listening workshop next term and use the videos with questions on Moodle. There are other recommendations for how to practise listening on Moodle too. In class you sometimes work hard but you need to be more consistent and make sure you complete homework regularly. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book.
Pink,"Liqun has made some progress, but still does not contribute to class discussions and is unable to answer questions in class. His English appears to be improving, but it is not improving fast enough. He now needs to redouble his efforts to understand the material and to improve his English. His formative result was acceptable and this bodes well for the future."
Pink,"Liquin demonstrates good understanding and communication skills, and contributes successfully to class discussions when he is present. His writing skills are fair but do need further development. Liquin scored 64% in his first formative assessment, which shows he has a good chance of progressing towards his chosen degree. If he attends classes regularly, he has a chance of progressing."
Pink,"You have a problem with your attention in class because often when I ask you questions, you seem to not be following me. I often have to repeat a subject and question twice to you. If you do not understand something, please ask me during class.Your formative was good but I believe you still need to work on it to meet the progression mark. You need to show more commitment towards studying otherwise I am not sure you will manage to progress."
Amber,
Pink,Liqun is remaining at his previous standard of work and not engaging with classroom discussions/questions. His language skills are still very low and his level of concentration is poor.
Amber,
Pink,"Due to your poor attendance throughout the year, you have missed a lot of the material we covered. Unless you take some responsibility yourself and start reading, trying to catch up, you will not manage to progress. I have already tried to make this clear to you during the workshop but it seems you did not get what I meant."
Amber,"Liqun needs to contribute more in class and always be prepared. His writing and listening grades need to improve to ensure progression to his next chosen course. To achieve this he should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up his writing skills. He should read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen as well as complete all of the practice tests in the AES books."
Pink,"Liqun does not get involved in classes and is unable to answer direct questions when asked. It appears that he has some capability, but he is not focussed on his studies and this means that he runs the risk of failing the course."
Amber,"Liquin - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."
Red,"Mr Liqun needs to show much more determination towards progressing. He has missed many classes and he is far behind in comparison to other ""weak students"". He needs to do more independent study (he was instructed and shown how to do so during workshops) and show much more determination towards his studies. Otherwise, he will find it very difficult to progress."

Amber,"Chamawee works hard in AES classes and participates actively in group discussions.  Chamawee’s formative seminar assessment result was particularly commendable; she demonstrated a notable  ability to engage thoughtfully and considerately with her peers.  Although the overall AES result from combined AES assessments was indicative of a good pass, the reading result shows room for improvement.  It might be helpful in coming weeks to utilise the independent study materials on Moodle and the reading exam practice texts in the back of the AES workbook to develop reading skills and to practise answering exam style questions."
Amber,"You have worked hard this term so well done. However, there are areas in which you can develop next term. The main area for you to concentrate on next term is your participation in class. You do not talk much, either in small groups or in larger discussions, and this is holding you back. You should try and change this, first by starting to talk a little more in smaller groups and then by adding to class discussion. The other thing which you really need to improve is your engagement with the set texts: it's really important that you prepare them well so you can get the most out of lessons. Your assignment was good and if you focus on aspects of it for improvement (which we will discuss) then you should do better next time round. Overall, there is plenty for you to build on next term."
Amber,"Feris is a good student. She responds readily to all the tasks and always seems very positive. It would be beneficial to encourage her to be more curious, active during the class and free in expressing herself verbally."
Amber,"I believe you are an able student but you will need to improve in order to attain a progression mark. While your formative assignment mark was okay, you need to show more commitment towards studying."
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,I believe Femmie has the potential to progress but she needs a bit more individual/personal studying and determination. She has to identify by herself areas where she thinks she needs help and come to me for support. I have already tried to help her with some of the theories which she did not understand but she needs to take responsibility by herself as well and come forward with things she does not understand.
Amber,"Chamawee passed both the summative speaking seminar and the listening exam at the beginning of Term 2 but there is room for improvement in the listening result and there will be an opportunity to take another summative test in Term 3.  In order to develop listening, reading and writing skills in coming weeks, and to gain higher results in summative assessments in Term 3, it may be helpful to review the independent study material which is available on Moodle, and to work through all of the practice exam material in the back of the AES Workbooks."
Amber,"Your formative assignment mark in Arts gives you a good foundation to build on for your final summative assignment - well done. It shows evidence that you have worked hard, engaging with the text and that you understand what you need to do in Arts. You should look at the feedback so that you know what to do differently next time and this will help you when you come to you final assignment. At the same time, it would be good to hear from you a bit more in class. You remain very quiet, as though you are worried about participating. You understand more than you think, so say a bit more, please! It will help you understand more of the topics in question."
Amber,"Feimi is a good student who shows considerable interest in F&M as subject matter. She works well as part of a team, but could do more in class"
Red,I believe Femmie will be unable to progress. She was the only one of the Resits who failed (29 after a deduction of 10 for lateness). Her paper was only 700 words out of 1500 word limit. Unless she puts a lot of extra work during term 3 it will be extremely difficult for her to progress.

Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class. 
Neil joined the class later and missed some topics. His initial test result was very low. Hi needs to start to attend the Maths workshop regularly in order to catch up."
Green,
Green,
Green,"Neil’s positive attitude to learning and the respect he consistently shows towards his tutors and classmates alike make him a real pleasure to teach. His formative AES assessment results indicate he has a very firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and is more than capable of putting them into practice. Provided he continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity, I have no doubts whatsoever that Neil’s summative results will be of an equally high standard and he will achieve progression requirements in all aspects of the AES module. During the Spring Break, Neil should start working on his AES research project so that he can get started on his CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Neil has difficulties with understanding the material and working together with class. He also missed a lot of classes and Maths workshops. He needs as much help as possible including attendance of all classes and workshops and extra tuition as well."
Green,Neil - you are attentive in class but at times you lose focus. I am pleased though that you are happy to answer questions in class. Your listening skills are good and generally your work in class is of a good quality but you have obviously not taken enough time to complete your formative assessment; do not put yourself in this position when it comes to your summative. You have good analytical skill  which will be very useful in helping you to progress on to RH. You just need to learn to manage your time better.
Green,Neil is a capable student but he needs to be more committed. His attendance is less than 100% and this will mean he does not achieve the standards of which he is capable.
Green,
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Neil got just 4% in the S1 test. He clearly is well behind the rest of the class. He had a plan to do some recovery work during the Easter break, but I do not think he did any work. His attendance is very bad. In order to prepare for the resit of S1 he needs to start working hard, attend all classes and the  Maths workshop."
Amber,
Amber,
Green,"Neil performed very well in his summative speaking and listening exams this term, scoring distinction marks in both assessments. However, as he has not submitted his CW1 on time, he has failed to demonstrate his ability to put into practice relevant academic research and essay planning skills taught in AES thus far. Neil should thus submit his CW1 in theTerm 3 resit session and ensure he plans his time properly in order to submit CW3 on time.  Provided he follows these guidelines, I have no doubt whatsoever, that Neil will meet his progression requirements in the AES module."
Red,Neil struggles a little with accuracy and needs to check his work carefully.  He is however committed to his studies and tries hard to achieve his best although lacks confidence in his ability.  I believe he will do his very best to achieve a better grade than he did in the mock statistics S2 exam.
Amber,"Neil - Your attitude is good in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 73%, please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills and accounting, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result"
Amber,"For his recent summative assignment Neil received a mark of 54%. This was disappointing and well below the level of which he is capable.

Neil has experienced some health issues and this, coupled with his inability to get up in the morning is affecting his levels of achievement.

He shows a good knowledge and background understanding of the subject to task and his written English is very successful and generally fluent. His arguments as presented in the essay sometimes lacked coherence, probably as he had not referred to any of the recommended texts, the only references being internet, which he knows, is not satisfactory."

Pink,It is still early days but I am concerned that Siying's level of English and her understanding is below that which is required to benefit fully from this course.
Pink,English proficiency needs to be improved to reach progression.
Pink,"Ashley has made little progress in listening and writing, which need extra effort to improve as she has scored below 40% in her listening assessment, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Her writing score is also well below the writing requirement of her chosen degree. Attending listening and writing workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are all likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Pink,Ashley is a good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. She takes part in group discussions but seems somewhat reserved and shy
Red,Siying finds politics demanding. Her English is not strong and it is difficult to be sure how much she is taking in.  Rarely contributes of her own free will.
Pink,Ashley's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a very poor knowledge of sociology. I recommend to get more involved in the class discussions and to allocate time for independent study.
Red,"Ashley makes little progress in listening, writing and speaking, which need extra effort to improve. There is a substantial gap between her exam results and the entry requirements.  She should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. Try to be more actively engaging in class. Speaking more English, doing extensive listening exercises, attending writing and listening workshops and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,
Pink,Siying's command of English remains very low and I have real concerns as to how much of this politics course she is really absorbing.
Pink,Ashley may reach progression but she needs to invest more time in independent study. I advise to start from reading the required sections in the textbook .
Pink,"Ashley demonstrates little progress being made in the AES course. When present, she tends to be quiet in lesson discussions, sometimes not fully focused on the content and shows a limited understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. She is advised to hand all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Attending writing and listening workshops is still recommended. Participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve her chances of progression."
Amber,"Ashley is a very quiet student who does not participate in class discussions much at all. She also did not submit a formative assignment at all, which made it very hard for me to gauge her progress at this point in the course. If she is to do well at the end of the course, she needs to start engaging more closely with the texts and participating more fully. She should also attend her tutorial ready to discuss her progress and think about next steps so she can be as successful as possible over the next few weeks."
Pink,"Siying is still very quiet in seminars and it is not clear how much she is understanding. Her contributions are rarely, if ever, spontaneous.

Her attendance has also been sporadic.

She received a mark of 56% for her recent summative essay which showed a good knowledge of many of the aspects relevant to a study of the legal system, in England and Wales, although it was confused in places.

Her arguments sometimes lacked coherence and there was little evidence of background reading. Her written English was generally good and accurate."

Pink,"Daisy has made little progress this term. Her listening and writing skills, in particular, need further development, as she has scored below 40% in her listening and writing assessments, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are all likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Pink,Fangni does not participate in class discussions and she is unable to answer a question when asked. This appears to be as a result of poor language skills and these now need to be developed further and faster.
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Fangni clearly has difficulties with understanding the material. She missed a few classes and did not attend the Maths workshop. She needs to work extra hard on her Maths course to avoid the risk of failing. She needs to attend all classes and workshops and do exercises at home."
Amber,"Daisy - You are very quiet in the class, but when a question is asked of you directly, you demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the subject. You need to  improve on your confidence. Additionally, your writing needs to improve too. I see you have the potential to progress, and I recommend you attend the workshop next term."
Pink,"Daisy demonstrates good learning attitudes. Her writing and listening skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Pink,Fangni scored 42 in summative 1 and is at risk of not achieving progression. She does not engage in class discussions and finds it very difficult to answer questions even when asked directly. The key issue is her language skills so she now needs to focus on improving her English if she is to have any chance of progressing.
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Fangni result was very disapointing - only 7%. She clearly needs to do more. She was absent last week during the classes and did not attend the Maths workshop. Please attend all classes, ask questions about the topics you do not understand and do your homework."
Pink,"Daisy performed poorly in her summative 1 assessment. She needs to concentration more in class and pay more attention to what is being covered so she can engage in some revision work outside of our sessions, helping to improve her understanding more. I do not think she is putting in the required effort for the course. My advice would be for her to turn this around."
Pink,"Daisy has made limited progress in AES course. When present, she tends to be quiet in lesson discussions, sometimes not fully focused on the content and shows a limited understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. She is advised to hand all of her homework in to a high standard. Attending writing workshops is still recommended. Attending all her workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve her chances of progression."
Pink,"Fangni continues to have difficulties participating in class discussions. She does have some understanding, but in general her understanding is poor and she is unable to answer questions when asked. This is also caused by her lack of ability in English. In order to be successful Fangni needs to increase her commitment to her studies and focus on improving her skill in english."
Red,Fangni had a very poor result in the statistics mock S2 test and whilst her formative 2 result was a little better it was still not a pass grade.  She must learn the concepts and practise utilising the formulae.  Fangni must make the best use for the two weeks left before the exam problem solving and seeking support when she comes across a difficulty.
Pink,"Daisy - Your attitude is improved  in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 57%, please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score in writing and accounting. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills and practice accounting questions, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result. You need to work hard to progress to RH"

Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class. Sidi joined the class later and missed some topics. Hi was invited to the Maths workshop in order to catch up, but he is not attending. I believe it is very important that he starts to attend."
Amber,
Pink,"Mohamed listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. He contributes to class discussions and when he does it enriches the learning environment. Mohamed has achieved below 60% in his overall grades, which is below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He is advised to hand all of his homework in on time and ensure he completes it to a high standard. Attending writing workshops is still recommended. Attending listening and writing workshops, participating more, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,Sidi appears to be a motivated student. His level of english language is good and his contributions in class are valuable. Sidi enjoys debates in class and contributes well.
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Mohamed's result is not great (only 24%), he also missed quite a lot of classes and did not attend the Maths workshop. On the other hand, when he is present, he works well in class, asks questions and tries to understand the material. I believe that he could achieve better results if he starts to attend classes and Maths workshop regularly."
Pink,"Mohammed - While you are good at answering questions some times, you seem too oftern to be distracted and lose focus eaisly. You need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I  think you are not putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week. I also feel that because of your writing skill in particular, you would benefit from attending workshop classes after Easter, especially as  your score for F1 was 38, which is far too low for a student like you."
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class. Results of the first summative test are missing as student was ill and did not take the test.
Sidi Mohamed has a reasonable understanding of material, but he needs to attend the classes regularly and practice at home in order to achieve good result in S1 test."
Amber,
Amber,"Mohamed shows a good learning attitude and actively contributes to all class discussions. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. His reading and writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to maximise his chances of progression. He is also advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard."
Green,"Sidi is a talented student. Occasionally he can allow his motivation to slip and he is not always concentrating in class, but his results for summative 1 were good and when he does contribute to class it is usually constructive and positive. He should continue to work on the course and should succeed in progression."
Amber,Sidi is making good progress now and is working hard to achieve his progression grade after a disappointing result in his mock statistics S2 test.
Amber,"Sidi - You have Improved your attitude towards studies, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 38%,please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score. My advice would be for you to concentrate on your writing skills and accounting as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result. Work hard practice all questions."

Pink,"You have been a satisfactory student in class and have sometimes tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening, reading and writing exams results are concerningly low. You will need to attend the listening and writing workshops next term as well as regularly practise your writing, reading and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle; for example, completing the listening videos with questions can help you prepare for Part 2 of the AES exam and TED talks will help you develop note-taking skills and strategies. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Amber,"You are a better student than you think - you mainly lack confidence. As your formative assignment shows, things are going much better than you think. However, there are several ways in which you could help yourself (and your confidence). The first is to ensure that you prepare for lessons by reading the texts. Although this is challenging, the more you do it, the easier it gets - so next term, please try and ensure that you keep up with the reading. The second is that you are incredibly quiet. Where possible you try not to participate in class - and also in group work (where if possible you try not to speak English - which is detrimental to your progress). The more you practise interpreting texts in English, the easier it will get. You are definitely capable of all of this, so please try and make sure that next term you work hard on improving this and you will see the rewards."
Amber,"Lechenxi is a very good student and responds well to the tasks; she works well especially in pair or as part of team. She seems very shy and should be encouraged to express herself more freely, especially verbally."
Amber,Your formative showed that you have some ability and understanding of what we are covering but you have to improve. You have to also improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. Talk more during our classes and discussions.
Pink,"You have been a satisfactory student in class and have sometimes tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening, reading and writing exams results are concerningly low.

Amber,
Amber,

Red,"Lechenxi often tries hard in class and participates well. However, she needs to work hard to achieve the grades she needs to pass this course. Her speaking skills are satisfactory but reading, writing and listening grades all need to improve. To achieve this she should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up her writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books."
Pink,"You are often very quiet in class, though recently you have contributed in class discussion, which was extremely welcome. You should try and do this more as it will help you learn more and develop your skills. One of the main barriers to your doing better is that you often appear not to have read the texts: you should try and engage more with the texts so that you have more to say. Although there were problems with your formative assignment, you would be able to score more highly if you paid attention to the feedback given. Next term, try and read the texts so that you can participate more in class and you will have a good foundation for your second summative assignment."
Amber,"Lechenxi is a student who shows interest in F&M as subject matter. She works well as part of team, but should put greater effort in her classwork and homework"
Amber,Lechenxi's mark has been in the range of a pass and she needs a bit more so she can progress. A bit more independent study in view also of the exam will most certainly help her.

Pink,"Jessie demonstrates a good learning attitude. Her speaking, listening and writing skills, however, need further development as she has scored well below 40% in her listening and writing assessments to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Participating more in class, attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are all likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Pink,Chuyu does not appear to engage with the class material and does not participate in class discussions or ask questions. She is unable to answer questions when directly asked. This appears to be as a result of her lack of language skills. She now needs to tackle this issue and develop her language skills to give her a chance of progressing.
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Chuyu attendance was good, but she clearly has difficulties with understanding the material. The formative test result was very low (only 21%). She needs to attend the workshop, be more active in class and do the homework."
Amber,"Jess - You seem to be attentive in the class but lack focus, when questions are asked you demonstrate some knowledge and understanding of the subject. You needs to  improve on your confidence. Additionally, your writing needs to improve too. I see you have the potential to progress, and I recommend you attend the workshop next term."
Pink,"Jassie works hard in class. Her seminar skills and written work are now improved. Nevertheless, given the high entry requirements from RHUL, she needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on Moodle are likely to improve chances of progression."
Pink,Chuyu still does not engage with class discussions or activities. She is unable to answer questions when asked. The main issue is her lack of skill in English. If she wants to progress she will need to focus on improving in this area.
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Chuyu got only 27% in the S1 test. Clearly she needs to do more work, be more active in class, ask questions if something is not clear, attend all classes and Maths workshop  regularly  to prepare for the resit of S1 test."
Pink,"Jess is working a little better this term, but needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work in class and outside of class. My advice would be for her to engage in more self-study and attend all workshops."
Amber,"Jessie's attitude and the progress she's made in the AES course has been impressive. She has made satisfactory progress so far this term. Her reading and writing skills, however, need further development. I'd also advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to maximise her chances of progression. She is also advised to hand all of her homework in on time and to a high standard."
Amber,"Chuyu had disappointing results in summative 1. She also finds it very difficult to participate in class, often appearing to lack understanding of the material. Her lack of skill in english language is the main reason for this and she now needs to focus her efforts on rapid improvement if she is going to progress successfully."
Red,Chuyu was unable to achieve a pass grade in the recent mock statistics S2 test and must ensure she has a good understanding of how to use the basic formulae and find the appropriate sums for entering.  She must continue to practise problem solving to improve her grade.
Amber,"Jess - Your attitude is improved  in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 71%, please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score in writing. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills and practice revision questions, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result. You need to work hard to progress to RH"

Green,"Lindi has proved herself to be a very diligent, hardworking and talented student who can always be counted on to make interesting and insightful contributions to class discussions. All the work she had produced this term has been of very high quality and clearly showed she has a very firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and is more than capable of putting them into practice.  Provided Lindi continues working with the same level of dedication and integrity, I have no doubts whatsoever that her summative results will be of an equally high standard. During the Spring Break, Lindi should start working on the AES research project so that she can get started on CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Lindiwe's attendance is good. She also attends the Maths workshop regularly. Her result for the first formative test is not high enough (29%), but I am confident that if she continues to attend regularly, work hard, ask questions, do exercises at home,
we will see a quick improvement of her understanding and results."
Green,"Native speaker, with prior knowledge of the subject and seeking to study Psychology also. I have no concerns over her progression at all. One of the best students in class."
Green,Lindi's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a very good of sociology. Her seminar contributions have been very valuable and they show depth of knowledge and an ability to engage critically with various sociological issues.
Green,
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Lindiwe result for S1 is not good enough. She missed a few classes and workshops which does not improve her chances of getting reasonable results during the S1 resit. Please start to attend regularly before it is too late."
Green,
Green,
Green,"Lindi has continued to work hard this term and performed very well in her Listening exam and CW1. She shows excellent awareness of academic conventions governing research and academic writing and is able to put those into practice when completing her assignment. Provided she shows equal diligence in the last term of her studies, Lindi will have no trouble whatsoever meeting progression requirements for her chosen degree at RHUL."
Red,Lindiwe demonstrates confidence and with better attendance and attention to study she could achieve much more.  She was absent from the mock statistics S2 test and will need to be practising problem solving to be able to work on the problems without support.
Green,Lindi undoubtedly has the potential to achieve a lot in her academic career. She is the most knowledgeable of the subject amongst the group and this is reflected both in discussions in class and her exams.
Green,A very strong student who needs to ensure she revises well to show her full potential in the final assessment. Well done.

Pink,Hui preliminary test result is very low. Unfortunately there is a clash in the timetable and student could not attend the Maths workshop. It is necessary to do extra work between classes and ask questions is something is unclear.
Amber,
Pink,"Hui demonstrates a good learning attitude. His listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below 40% in his listening assessment, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. His writing score is barely above the writing requirement of his chosen degree. Attending listening and writing workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. He may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Pink,Hui has not made any impact in classes. This appears to be as a result of his low level of skill in English so this is where he needs to focus in order to make the most of the course materials.
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Hui test result is very low (only 23%). He is attending, but he is not very active in class. He needs to pay more attention during the classes, start to attend the workshop and do a lot of work between classes."
Amber,"HUI - You seem to be attentive in the class but lack focus, when questions are asked you demonstrate some knowledge and understanding of the subject. You needs to  improve on your confidence. Additionally, your writing needs to improve too. I see you have the potential to progress, and I recommend you attend the workshop next term."
Amber,
Pink,"Hui does make efforts to listen in class, but his language skills are very poor. This means that he appears to struggle to keep up with the class discussion and is unable to participate, even when asked direct questions. His summative result was reflective of this issue. If Hui is to succeed he must now concentrate on improving his English."
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Hui got 32% in S1 test, so there is work to be done. I am glad that Hui is attending classes and Maths workshop, is active, ask questions, so I am hopeful that he will have better results for the resit of S1 test."
Amber,
Amber,"Hui shows a good learning attitude and actively contributes to all class discussions. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. His listening and writing skills, however, need further development.  I'd also advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to maximise his chances of progression."
Amber,Hui continues to have issues with understanding in class. His attendance has dropped recently and he appears to have lost motivation. In order to succeed he needs to focus on his studies and restart his levels of motivation from the beginning of the course.
Red,Hui achieved a pass grade in his formative 2 test but did not attend the mock statistics S2 test.  He is not a strong candidate and to improve his chance of achieving a respectable grade in the final exam he must ensure he is practising problem solving and learning the necessary formulae.  Hui must seek help when he does not understand and take full advantage of the support available in the last two weeks.
Pink,"Hui - Your attitude is improved  in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 34%, please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score in writing. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills and practice revision questions, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result. You need to work hard to progress to RH."

Green,Ry is a very good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. He keenly participates in the classwork and takes part in group discussions
Green,"Rai is a good student, dedicated and attentive during class. He is very good in note-taking and often has good comments during our discussions. I have no concerns over his progression."
Amber,Sooyoung's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 does not reflect his ability to engage with various sociological issues which was evident during the seminar discussions. I recommend to allocate more time for independent study and improve the seminar attendance.

Provided his personal circumstances do not prevent him from completing his coursework and sitting his exams, I have no doubt Ry will be able to meet progression requirements for his chosen degree at RHUL."
Amber,"Sooyoung has been absent due to extenuating circumstances for a considerable proportion of this term, so it is difficult for me to write about his progress, especially as he has not submitted a formative assignment. However, it is clear that he is a capable student, especially when he focuses. He should aim to participate as much as possible in class and prepare carefully for classes and hopefully this will lead to success with his second summative assignment."
Amber,"Rai's attendance levels have fallen down due to personal problems and this has affected also his determination to complete the course. While his assignments were good, I believe these personal issues will hinder his completion of the course."

Pink,"Liuyi is often disengaged or even asleep in AES classes.  He seems to be a relatively able student and demonstrates some competence when answering direct questions, but his ability to produce the necessary quality of written work for AES will likely be hindered by a lack of attention to lesson content. I would recommend carefully reviewing the first few weeks' lesson slides on Moodle and raising any related questions in drop-in sessions."
Green,
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,"Liuyi appears to have had difficulty participating in AES classes this term, often seeming sleepy and disengaged in lesson time.  His formative assessment results demonstrate that he is capable of achieving passable grades, but it seems likely that he has the potential to improve significantly if more focussed attention were to be given to skills development.  In the coming term, it may be particularly beneficial for Liuyi to utilise both online materials (Listening: Independent Skills Practice on the AES Moodle webpage) and to attend the listening workshops which are available to all AES students."
Green,Liuyi has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Amber,"Sun has recently started to become a lot more attentive in class and his work is showing increasing understanding of key concepts and ideas within Economics. Unfortunately, Sun received a grade of 55% in his first formal formative assessment, but this was due to his late submission which meant he was given a penalty. He must ensure that he does not incur anymore penalties for any future work. With a little bit of hard work and a little more concentration in class, I am confident he will make good progress."
Amber,"Your formative showed that you have some ability and understanding of what we are covering but you have to improve. 

You seem to understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. 

A bit more commitment from you can do wonders as you are a very able student; lazy, yet able."
Amber,
Green,
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,"Liuyi passed both the summative listening exam and the speaking (seminar) assessment at the beginning of Term 2, but there remains considerable room for him to achieve an improved results in forthcoming assessments.  It would be advisable to take every opportunity to listen to proficient spoken English, both in academic and other contexts, to help improve familiarity with fluent intonation and delivery, and to engage as much as possible with discussions in class to practise speaking.  Having missed some key lesson input in relation to academic writing skills in recent weeks, Liuyi should review lesson material for any missed classes."
Green,He works well in classes and has a good understanding of the subject. He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work to progress and achieves his goal.
Amber,"Sun - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress. However, I would recomend you attend workshop classes after Easter."

It would be advisable to work through the Oxford Grammar for EAP book in independent study time, and to attend drop-in sessions with any questions or comprehension difficulties that may arise.  Ali also achieved a rather low mark in the initial listening assessment in class time.  This was partly due to his late arrival, but attendance at Listening Workshops will help develop the skills required to cover any existing gaps in listening ability."
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,"Alican achieved an overall pass in formative AES assessments in Term 1, but there remains considerable room for improvement in all skills areas.  Whilst his seminar assessment result was encouraging, it may be helpful for Alican to attend both listening and writing workshops in Term 2; these are available to all AES students.  It may also be beneficial to review all of the material covered in Term 1 in order to fill knowledge gaps resulting from missing classes; absences may have compromised Alican’s grades."
Amber,"Ali has a positive attitude in class, but is sometimes distracted. His English language skills are acceptable and he should take advantage of this skill. His formative result was disappointing, but if he takes the feedback seriously this should improve. He should now take his studies more seriously and undertake follow up reading for topics that he does not understand from the class."
Green,"Ali is a pleasure to teach. He is attentive and hardworking and I am very pleased with the attitude he has towards his studies. He is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Unfortunately, he achieved 56% in his first formal formative assessment because he messed up a little in his work - something we discussed in our one to one tutorial. I feel he has good potential and look forward to seeing this in his first summative assessment straight after the winter holidays."
Amber,"Ali has made good progress in the last few months. His formative essay and contributions in class show an increasing confidence in the use of key concepts and a developing ability to engage critically with different issues of politics. With wider reading and independent study, I am confident his progress will be successful."

Pink,Mustafa is working well in AES classes but his written work demonstrates significant need for improvement in order to reach the standards expected at this level.  It would be advisable for Mustafa to use the Oxford Grammar for EAP book for independent study and to attend drop-in sessions with any questions that may arise as he progresses through each unit.
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Green,"Mustafa’s formative assessment results in all skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking) have been encouraging this term.  Writing appears to be the area with the greatest scope for further improvement and in order to make progress in this regard it would be particularly good to review the Term 1 AES classes on referencing; using accurate paraphrasing and citation in academic writing is a key skill which students need to demonstrate in order to achieve high grades.  Completing vocabulary exercises and quizzes on Moodle, and possibly engaging in more extensive reading, could also be helpful in broadening Mustafa’s academic vocabulary."
Pink,Mustafa needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week and during the holiday as he did not get a good mark in the formative assessment
Green,Mustafa had a good understanding and achieved a good formative assessment mark. Should reach progression if he continues working at his current level.
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Mustafa can understand the material in class reasonably well. Unfortunately, he is easily distracted and does not work to his full potential. He needs to pay more attention during the classes, take notes and practice at home regularly."

In order to prepare adequately for future AES assessments, Mustafa could also benefit from working through the practice exam material in the Term 2 AES Workbook."
Amber,He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week to progress and achieves his goal
Green,"He has extensive knowledge of physics and works very well during classes, and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up."
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative and second formative assessments. 
Mustafa got good results (above 70%) in both tests. Unfortunately he is not trying to learn more, he does not work to his full potential. This approach could be very dangerous as we start to study more advanced and difficult questions. He needs to attend all classes, work in class and home regularly in order to achieve high results during the summer examination."

Amber,
Green,
Pink,"Guangquan is a capable student and has the potential of meeting his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree; however, he needs to show this fully in his AES classes and exams. He is easily distracted in class and therefore needs to focus more and start taking greater responsibility for his own English language learning - using English as much as possible rather than Chinese. In term 2 I hope to see an overall improvement in engagement and I strongly advise him to attend listening and writing workshops to help support his English language skills."
Pink,"Overall, it is hard to comment on your progress much this term as you do not always attend my classes. Additionally, when you are present, you often appear distracted. Moreover, your formative assignment mark was not strong: we can discuss this further (and the issues that contributed to that) in your tutorial. There are various things you can do to improve, which will help you in your lessons. First, you need to make the effort to prepare for my lessons. The more you read, the easier it gets, so you really need to break that wall down. You also need to concentrate in my lessons and make the effort to participate in group work as well as in class discussions. You should also attend the workshops, which are there to help and support your progress."
Pink,"Leo demonstrates clear interest in film as a subject matter. Language seems to be a barrier for his better performance in class, as he frequently seems insecure in expressing himself in English. It would be advisable to encourage him to speak more freely."
Pink,"Your essay was plagiarised to a great extent (95%) and it was commented on the essay. You missed your class on Friday where I held tutorials so I could not talk about this with you directly. I am confident that your knowledge and understanding, as well as your English ability are enough for you to progress; you have to, however, commit to studying and putting in some effort, which you did not do for your formative."
Pink,"Guangguo is a capable student and has the potential to meet his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree. There has been an overall improvement in his engagement in class as he is trying to focus more and complete tasks to a satisfactory level. It is good to see that he passed his summative listening, but he should continue to work on all aspects of his English skills and reduce his Mandarin speaking time in class and carry out research in English. I strongly advised him to work on his reading skills and attend listening workshops to help support his English language skills."
Pink,"You are very quiet in class - and your summative assignment seemed as though you had not really understood the question. All in all, you need to engage more with both classes and workshops in order to improve your work and hope of progressing next year."
Amber,
Green,
Pink,Guangquan needs to dedicate more time to improving his overall English level in order to help him achieve the best possible grade. He needs to continue to work hard and focus on improving his listening as his summative listening result although better is only 42%. I also strongly advise him to work on his reading and academic writing skills for the practice and build on his vocabulary. There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook.
Pink,"Your formative assignment mark shows that you are engaging with the work in arts to an extent that means you could participate in class far more than is currently the case. Your mark is solid, but it would be good to see this replicated in class, when you do not really engage with group work or class discussions. Instead, it would be good to hear from you so that you can build on this for next time. This would mean that you can work towards scoring more highly for your summative assignment."
Amber,"Leo is a good student who shows considerable interest in F&M as subject matter. He works well as part of team, but should put greater effort in his classwork and homework"
Amber,Mr Guo needs just a bit more determination to progress. His Summative 1 was good (despite of my suspicions that there was an academic misconduct there) and he just needs a bit more effort to progress.

Green,
Amber,
Pink,"You have been a satisfactory student in class and have sometimes tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening, reading and writing exams results are concerningly low. You will need to attend the listening and writing workshops next term as well as regularly practice your writing, reading and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle; for example, completing the listening videos with questions can help you better prepare for Part 2 of the AES exam and listening to TED talks will help you develop note-taking skills and strategies. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Amber,"Well done for your formative assignment mark. It is difficult to tell how engaged you are with the course as you rarely contribute to the course and even in group work do not seem to interact with other people that much. It is therefore hard for me to comment on your progress. Next term please make the effort to prepare more for my classes, contribute more and generally take a more proactive role. If you do that, you will see ample rewards in your progress!"
Amber,"Wilson demonstrates curiosity and clear interest in film as subject matter, as well as good prior knowledge. He is active in class. It would be beneficial if he invested more in expressing himself clearly both verbally and in writing, and if he approached his tasks with greater focus and understanding."

Amber,"Wilson is sometimes keen and attentive member of the class. He often contributes well and asks when he needs help. His results are satisfactory, but he needs to improve his listening score and to some extent his other scores to ensure progression to his chosen course. He should practise more by completing more of the listening tests. He could also attend the AES listening workshops. There are many other resources on Moodle he also could use."
Amber,"You have shown a much better attitude this term - well done. Your second formative assignment is a solid foundation and some of the main issues with it are easy for you to rectify (such as engaging more closely with your chosen text). It would still be good to hear from you. Although you have become much better at participating in group work, which is good to see, you are still reluctant to say anything in class. Participation in class discussion and close reading of the texts are the main two areas for you to concentrate on as we start to focus on the final assignment in Term 3."
Green,"Wilson is a good student who shows considerable interest in F&M as subject matter. He works well as part of team, but should put greater effort in his classwork and homework"
Amber,"Wilson has improved so much during this year. While his formative was not good, I am certain he will do much better once he actually studies for it. He has come a long way and I believe he just needs a final push now to succeed in getting a progression mark. Well done."

You have valuable contributions to make and this is good experience for you too. You also work well in groups. I suspect your formative assignment mark came as a (welcome!) surprise to you: you need to believe in yourself more! You are much more capable than you believe and if you carry on working hard you should do well. Focus a little more on preparation outside the classes (i.e. reading the texts) and you will have an excellent foundation for your work for the rest of the year. Overall, you should be very pleased with your work this term!"
Green,"Karris demonstrates creativity, curiosity and clear interest in film as subject matter. She expresses herself more readily in writing than verbally, and should be encouraged to speak up more freely."
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. 

Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this.
You have the capabilities for much higher marks."
Pink,"You sometimes try hard to participate in class but you need to make sure you do this more consistently. Your listening exam score is concerningly low. You need to work hard to improve this. You must attend the listening workshop. In class you sometimes work hard but you need to be more consistent especially by speaking more. In order to progress you need to keep working hard on your writing skills as well, so it would be advisable to attend the writing workshops as well."
Green,
Green,
Amber,
Pink,"Karris needs to contribute more in class. She needs to keep focused. Her reading, writing and listening grades all need to improve to ensure progression. To achieve this she should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up her writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. There are many other resources on Moodle he also could use."
Amber,"Although you have laid solid foundations, you have not been participating as fully in class as you once were, which means that your mark for your formative is not quite as good as it might have been. If you return to engaging well with the texts and the classwork, then you still have a very good chance of progressing. Looking ahead to next term, you need to focus on your participation in class and your engagement with the texts to ensure that you have the foundation that will enable you to do well in the summative assignment."
Green,Karis is a very student who shows interest in F&M as subject matter. She keenly does her homework and classwork and puts admirable effort to work as part of a team
Amber,I believe Karris has the capabilties to achieve a progression mark. She has had her ups and downs throughout the year but she is really close to the end now. A bit more effort and I am sure she will be able to progress.

Pink,"I believe that she is putting some effort in the course. She is very quiet during the class and one of the things I would ask is for her to start talking more. I do not have major worries over her passing but she does need to put some effort for a progression.A good idea for her would be to attend workshops, both for Psychology and English language, as well as create a glossary of concepts we examine (if she has not yet done so, as I have asked them to do so) and make sure she is able to define all of them."
Pink,"You have been a good student in class and have tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening and writing exams results are concerningly low. You will need to attend the listening and writing workshops next term as well as regularly practise your writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle; for example, completing the listening videos with questions can help you prepare for Part 2 of the AES exam and TED talks will help you develop note-taking skills and strategies. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Pink,Wai Shan is under performing in class. She must attend workshops more regularly in order to progress. I advise her to work harder in her spare time and to speak with me regularly if she is struggling to understand the work.
Amber,"Kimberly is a good student and is mostly attentive in class. Although she tends to remain relatively quiet herself in class discussions, her work shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Kimberley has achieved around 70% in her first formal formative assessment, which is a very good result for her for this term. I am sure she will continue to make good progress with her positive attitude."
Pink,"You formative essay was a case of plagiarism and it has been raised with you.I have to admit that I am not overly confident with your ability to understand the subjects we cover in class. You often seem to drift away and not pay attention in class, something bad given that your understanding skills are not the best.You have to improve on your commitment and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. Attendance of workshops is highly advisable. Independent reading as well. Do not miss classes as when you do so you remain behind. Unless you put some effort yourself I am afraid about your ability to progress."
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,"Kim is a keen and attentive member of the class. She contributes well and asks when she needs help. Her writing, reading and listening grades all need to improve to ensure progression to his next chosen course. To achieve this she should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up her writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books."
Amber,She is very quiet in class. She needs to work hard to progress this year. I would advise her to arrange a few personal tutorials with me to place a learning plan in her own time
Amber,"Kimberley - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."
Pink,"Kim has been a bit of a riddle throughout the year. She usually stays quite in class and even if asked, she will respond through one-word answers. Although she will very likely pass, she needs to pay more attention and follow clear instructions towards her S2 to attain a progression mark."

Pink,"You are clearly trying hard, but struggle at times. It is important that you try and participate a bit more in group work as well as in whole-class discussion as you could learn a lot more from doing so and this would really help your progress."
Green,
Pink,"I believe Meiyi does understand the course but she is very timid and shy. I do not have any kind of information about her ability or understanding as she has never spoke in class. I need her to start talking about her own opinion and ideas so I can be sure of her understanding. Workshop attendance is advisable, at least so she can unblock herself and be able to speak during classes."
Amber,"Meiyi is generally doing well and making good progress in her class work and exam and this is reflected in her formative exams results. She should try to dedicate time to improving her listening skills to ensure she meets progression and try to participate more in group discussions - this will help the flow of ideas and improve the interaction between group members. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practice tasks and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, she should attend listening workshops to further support her English studies."
Green,"You have worked hard in Arts this term - so well done! This has paid off with an excellent mark for your formative assignment. You also understand a lot more than you think. You seem to struggle more with your confidence than the actual content of the course. You are incredibly quiet in class, both in small groups and also in class discussion. Much as it is hard to contribute in seminar and lecture environments, it would be good to hear you do so as you are a capable student and this would help your development. This where you should concentrate your efforts next term. In the meantime, you have done well this term."
Green,Eve is a very good student. She responds readily to all the tasks and always seems very positive. She seems very shy. It would be beneficial to encourage her to be more active during the class and free in expressing herself verbally.
Green,Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this. You are an able student and you can most definitely achieve progression if you continue with the same commitment. You can also take a bit more initiative and talk more during classes.
Amber,
Green,
Green,
Amber,
Amber,"Meiyi remains quietly engaged and focused in class. Her listening and speaking summative results have been pleasing and she should continue to work on them to achieve the best grade possible. Meiyi has already got good reading and writing skills and it must be mentioned that her writing skills, in particular, have improved a lot this term. I believe that as long as she keeps practising and applying the skills she will do well . There are practice activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook to help support her English studies."
Green,"You are a much more capable student than you realise. Your second formative result gives you a solid foundation to build on - and this stands you in good stead for your second summative. You work hard and this is good to see. However, you are very reticent in class. It would be good to hear more from you, as when pressed you make intelligent contributions. Try and participate more, as well as building on the foundations laid by your formative assignment, and you have the tools to do well in your second summative."
Green,Eve is an excellent student who shows great interest in F&M as subject matter. She keenly does her homework and classwork and works well as part of a team
Green,Eve has shown determination towards achieving a progression mark and I believe she will manage to do so. She just needs to continue showing same determination and attitude during the last term as well.

Amber,
Pink,You are very quiet in class and you do not always ask questions when you don't understand. Please make sure you ask as this will help your learning going forward into the next half term. You should also try harder to take an active part in group and class work as you are currently very quiet - this is definitely something to aim for over the next half term.
Green,
Amber,
Pink,"Yufan is a good student, but he needs to improve on his overall performance in class. An area to improve on is his participation in group discussions - it will help the flow of ideas and improve the interaction between group members. His formative grades generally show that he needs to work much harder to improve his level of English in order to progress onto his chosen degree. During winter break he should work on completing all AES reading practice exams and 2 essays and some of the listenings on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise attending writing and listening workshops to support his English studies."
Pink,"You are exceptionally quiet in class and do not really contribute to class discussions either in lectures or seminars. You should aim to change this so that you can get the maximum benefit from your classes. In group work, you should also try to participate more fully as you are very quiet and this means that you do not develop as well as you could. Your formative assignment shows that you are more capable than you think, so it would be good to see this translated into the classroom - next term I would like to see you prepare texts more thoroughly (the more you do this, the easier it gets) so that you can participate more fully."
Amber,"Winston is a good student and always seems very positive. He works well as part of a team, but seems quite shy. He expresses clear interest in documentary film.  
It would be beneficial to encourage him to be more active during class and free in expressing herself verbally."
Green,I believe you are a very able student and you will have no issue with progressing. A bit more commitment from you can take you to the next level as I believe you have the capabilities to achieve more.
Pink,There has been some improvement in Yufan's performance in both his classwork and assessments. He has shown more engagement in class especially in aspects of speaking; but he needs to make a conscious effort to work on his listening skills as this is his weakest skill and this is reflected in his summative result. I strongly advise him to continue attending writing and listening workshops to support his English studies and make use of the drop-in clinic that is available to Sept students.
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,"Vincent can most definitely progress but he needs to push himself a bit more in terms of independent studying. He needs to practice a bit more in his English expression, as he does have the knowledge but needs to improve on his expression of that knowledge."
Amber,"Yufan's summative listening and speaking grades have seen an improvement and this only stands to prove that with some effort and commitment to the task he can produce some pleasing results. Yufan is quiet by nature, but this term he has made the effort to contribute more to pair and group work which is pleasing to see as he has some good ideas. He needs to take on board the feedback to help him improve his marks, particularly his writing. He should continue to practise listening and complete some reading and writing skills exercises by using the exam practice booklets in the appendices section of the AES workbook and attend classes so that he can practise these skills."
Pink,"You are extremely quiet in class, even in group work, to the extent that it is hard to work out whether you understand. You should try and change this so that you can make more progress. Your formative assignment showed evidence that you understand more than you think, but there were also problems with it. If you solve some of these problems (which would be easily done) then you would score much more highly. Next term, try and engage more with the texts, as well as discussions in class, to enable you to participate in class more fully."
Amber,"Vincent is a good student who shows considerable interest in F&M as subject matter. He works well as part of team, but should put greater effort in his classwork and homework"
Amber,Vincent's Resit was of a very good quality and he achieved a really good mark (72). I have no worries at this point about his progression. He will need to do some more independent study towards the final exam however.

Amber,
Pink,You are very quiet in class and there have been occasions when you have not asked questions when you don't understand. You can always ask questions and this will help your learning going forward so please do make sure you ask if you're not sure about something. Additionally you should try harder to take an active part in group and class work as you are currently very quiet so this is something to aim for over the next half term.
Amber,
Pink,"I believe Chenxi does understand the course but he does not talk in class. I do not have any kind of information or confirmation about his ability as he has never spoke in class. I need him to start talking about his own ideas so I can be sure of his understanding. Workshop attendance is advisable, at least so he can unblock himself and be able to speak during classes."
Green,"Chenxi has shown a high level of commitment to AES this term and his overall result following formative assessments is quite promising.  The listening assessment grade, which may be a cause for concern, could potentially be improved through practising listening and note-taking technique.  Chenxi could utilise both online materials (Listening: Independent Skills Practice on the AES Moodle webpage) and attend the listening workshops which are available to all AES students.  In order to improve overall comprehension and linguistic confidence, it may be helpful to work through all of the available vocabulary development material in the AES workbooks and on Moodle."
Amber,"You are very quiet in classes, but as your formative assignment mark shows you are a capable student. You need to make the effort to contribute more both in class and in small groups (where you are frequently reluctant to speak English). The more you engage with English texts, the easier it becomes, so please ensure you prepare better for lessons - only then will you gain maximum benefit from them. For next term, please try and make sure that you prepare better for classes and then use that preparation to contribute more actively."
Amber,"Chenxi is a good student and always seems very positive. He works well as part of a team.  
It would be beneficial to encourage him to be more active during class and free in expressing herself verbally."
Amber,"I believe your formative was quite okay but you still need to work in order to attain a good mark. 
You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. Try to be involved more in class and have at least one question each class."
Pink,"Chenxi’s summative listening exam results are a cause for concern at this stage in the IFY.  In order to improve his listening skills to pass the second summative listening exam, I would recommend that Chenxi attends the listening workshops and works through the listening materials for use in independent study time, which are on the AES Moodle page.  It may also be beneficial to try to gain more exposure to natural use of English language through television and media sources."
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,"Mr Chenxi is more than able to progress but he needs to be more attentive in class and to concentrate more. It is quite obvious that he has the potential, but he needs to put some effort by himself as well. Lately he has been improving but he needs to build on to that."
Pink,"Chenxi achieved a good result in the summative speaking seminar at the beginning of Term 2 but his first summative listening exam result was below pass standard.  It would be advisable for Chenxi to take every opportunity to listen to proficient spoken English, both in academic and other contexts, to help improve familiarity with fluent intonation and delivery, and to engage as much as possible with discussions in class to practise speaking and listening.  Chenxi might also benefit from working through the material in the Listening: Skills for Independent Study section on Moodle."
Pink,"You continue to be very quiet in class, though you do seem to try hard. One of the main barriers to success for you is that you do not really engage with the texts, which gives you a problem both for participation and for your development in the course. Your second formative mark was weak, but there were issues that can be easily solved, enabling you to score much more highly next time round. You are capable of doing better than you think. When you try hard to contribute to class discussion, you do better than you think. Try and build on that to improve your mark next term: read the texts and contribute in class discussion."
Green,"Chenxi is a good student who shows considerable interest in F&M as subject matter. He works well as part of team, but should put greater effort in his classwork and homework"
Green,"Mr. Chenxi has managed to pick up during this term and he has done very well. He is paying much more attention, contributing in class, etc. I wish he keeps this up until the end of the year, without me telling him off again."

Although you did well in your formative assignment, you seem to struggle in class, so you need to ensure that you continue to engage with the texts so that you are able to fully participate. You are exceptionally quiet in class and rarely say anything either in groups or in class discussion. If you could start to be more vocal this would really benefit you. You must make sure that you prepare well for classes by reading the texts so that you are able to take part as much as possible."
Amber,"Jenny is a good and engaged student. It would be beneficial if she invested more in expressing himself clearly both verbally and in writing, and if she approached her tasks with greater focus and understanding."
Amber,"You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this.

Pink,"Jenny often tries hard in class and participates well. However, she needs to work hard to achieve the grades she needs to pass this course. Her speaking skills are satisfactory but reading, writing, and especially listening grades need to improve. To achieve this she should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up her writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books."
Pink,"You are very quiet indeed in Arts. Sometimes you don't attend at all, and you have not submitted a formative assignment, which means it is very hard for me to gauge your progress. Moreover, you will not have assignment feedback to work from when it comes to your summative assignment at the end of Term 3. In order to start performing better in Arts, you need to begin by engaging better with the set texts. This would mean that you could participate more in class and deepen your understanding of the main topics and themes, which would give you a better foundation for your final assignment."
Amber,"Jenny is a student who shows interest in F&M as subject matter. She works well as part of team, but should put greater effort in her classwork and homework"
Pink,"Jenny's Sumamtive 1 was in the range of 60. She did not sit the exam for Formative 1 so I do not have an idea about her knowledge and ability on a written exam. Judging however from her ability to articulate ideas and concepts in class, she will have many issues with getting a good mark. Unless she pulls herself together, start paying attention in class, and show some effort, she will find it very difficult to attain a progression mark."

You need to work on improving your other skills particularly in writing and listening. I advise regularly practising these skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle: for example, the listening videos with questions or TED talks for note-taking skills and strategies. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book with the writing question attached."
Green,"You have made excellent progress this term in Arts: you have worked very hard and it has really paid off so well done. Making the choice to come to workshops has really benefitted you and your increased participation in class is great to hear. It's been lovely to hear from you in lectures as well - please keep this up. You have also made sure that you have prepared the texts so that you have insightful contributions to make so ensure that you carry on like this. You have also done well in your formative assignment so well done! All in all, you should be very pleased."
Green,"Zhao is an excellent student. She demonstrates great understanding of film and media as subject matter. She responds excellently to tasks, both verbally and in writing, and works very well as part of team."
Green,You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and have become passionate with the subject.

Your second formative assignment mark was very good, showing that you have a very solid basis to work from next term. If you work hard and focus on the feedback given, you have the ability to do well in your summative assignment. Carry on reading the texts and backing up this with secondary literature and you will be able to improve still further."
Green,Zhao is an excellent student who shows great interest in F&M as subject matter. She keenly does her homework and classwork and works well as part of a team
Green,The improvement and passion towards Sociology shown by Zhao this year has been extraordinary. No other student has had such improvement throughout this cohort. Her passion in Sociology furthermore is something I am proud to have planted the seed. I am certain we will see great things from her.

At this point in the course, it is difficult to know her level of understanding of Economics but with a bit of extra help I am confident she can progress. To help, I would recommend her to attend one Management and Economics workshop a week at least until the end of term."
Amber,
Pink,"Xiaoxue is focused and takes an active role in class activities. Although her formative grades generally show that she needs to work harder on improving her level of English, particularly listening, she is capable of meeting her English requirements providing she continues to work diligently and remains focused. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practice tasks and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise her to continue to attend listening workshops and attend writing workshops to support her English studies to ensure successful progression."
Green,Xiaohue has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and her first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Pink,"Snow is a hard working student who demonstrates good understanding and is currently working on improving her communication skills. She needs to build her confidence and aim to contribute more in class, as this will give her the opportunity to practice articulating her thoughts out loud and testing these against those of her peers. As Snow has scored 50% in her first formal formative assessment, she needs also to practice her writing skills and revise a little more in her own time. I advise her to attend the workshops more regularly as this will help her and give her a better chance of progressing."
Amber,"You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. Try to talk more in class so you can improve your general language skills also. A vocabulary list is advisable.

Your formative showed that you have some ability and understanding of what we are covering but you have to improve. I believe that you will do better in the summative if you apply what we have discussed in class and the feedback you got from the formative."
Amber,"In the first instance, Xiaoxue needs to minimise the amount of time she spends speaking Mandarin during her English lessons as this is affecting her overall English performance. Her summative grades so far have shown an overall improvement in her listening, however her speaking has seen a lower score. She now needs to focus on her summative reading and writing skills to ensure that she meets her English requirements. I strongly advise her to continue to attend listening workshops and attend writing workshops to support her English studies to ensure successful progression."
Green,
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,"Xiaoxue is a conscientious and hardworking student. There has been an improvement in her listening result, achieving 40% and so remains a skill that she should keep improving on. Her speaking result was a little disappointing because if she had done more preparation she would have scored more highly. Equally, she should really focus on practising her reading and academic writing skills as these are areas that need attention. There are practice activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook to help support her English studies."
Green,"She has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes, and her first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up."
Pink,Snow -  you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should do self-study every week and need to be more interactive during class. You need to improve your listening and writing skills and also improve your practice of accounting. I recoement you attend workshop classes after Easter.
Amber,"Snow will manage to pass and progress in Psychology. She has shown dedication and ability to comprehend the topics we have been discussing throughout the year. Although not her favourite subject, she seems to be able to comprehend everything we discuss.
I do believe she will need to improve a bit in her spoken language to also do well next year as an Undergraduate."

Pink,"Your average exam score is concerningly low. You need to try harder to communicate in English in class and let me know when you need help understanding what we have studied. You will need to attend the listening and writing workshops next term as well as regularly practice your writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle; for example, completing the listening videos with questions can help you prepare for Part 2 of the AES exam and TED talks will help you develop note-taking skills and strategies. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Pink,Zhihan is very quiet in class and it is not clear whether she is concentrating. She does not engage with class discussions and is unable to answer questions when asked. Her English appears to be holding her back and she must now focus on improving her language skills if she is to have any chance of progression at the end of the course. Her formative result was a reflection of this. Zhihan needs to immerse herself in English speaking and take the time to read the textbook/Moodle if she is to make progress in term 2.
Pink,Zhihan is under performing in class. She must attend workshops more regularly in order to progress. I advise her to work harder in her spare time and to speak with me regularly if she is struggling to understand the work.
Pink,"April demonstrates some understanding and has shown some improvement in her communication skills. She tries to contribute to class discussions when she is present. Her writing skills are fair, but need further development. April scored 53% in her first formal formative assessment, which shows she needs to work a little harder to progress, something she can certainly do. I recommend she attends workshop in the new academic year, as this will increase her chances of progressing."
Pink,You need to try harder to communicate in English in class and let me know when you need help understanding. Your average exam score needs to improve to ensure progression to your chosen undergraduate degree. You will need to regularly practice your writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle for example the listening videos with questions or TED talks for note-taking skills and strategies. You should also make sure you complete the writing practise tests at the back of the AES book with the writing question attached. You must attend the listening and writing workshops.

Pink,"April needs to contribute more in class and always be prepared. Her writing and listening grades need to improve to ensure progression to his next chosen course. To achieve this she should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up her writing skills. She should read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen as well as complete all of the practice tests in the AES books."
Pink,Zhihan is still very quiet in class. When asked direct questions she is unable to answer and this makes me think that her english skills are still not sufficient for her to complete the course successfully. She now needs to throw herself into learning the necessary language skills.
Amber,She did quite well in her resit assessment. She is very quiet in class. She needs to work hard to progress this year. I would advise her to arrange a few personal tutorials with me to place a learning plan in her own time
Pink,"April - you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to improve your listening writing skills, as well as work on your accounting. I recommend you attend workshop classes after Easter."

Pink,Frank appears to be a capable student but has not shown much willingness to work hard and try to develop his AES skills. As such I have seen little work from him. He needs to improve his attitude and would probably benefit from attending listening and writing workshops. He needs to participate in class activities more to fully realise his potential and maximise his chances of progression.
Amber,
Green,
Pink,"Hu Zhekai is a good student but is easily distracted by his peers. At this point in the course it is difficult to know how much he is absorbing of the class content, though one thing is clear, he needs to concentrate more in class overall. In order for him to progress I would recommend he attends one Management and Economics workshop a week until the end of term."
Pink,"Your listening exam score is concerningly low. You need to work hard to improve this. You must attend the listening workshop next term and use the videos with questions on Moodle. There are other recommendations for how to practise listening on Moodle too. In class, you sometimes work hard but you need to be more consistent and make sure you complete homework regularly. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Pink,Zhekai is very quiet in class. He doesn't contribute to class discussions and finds it difficult to answer questions when asked. His formative was very disappointing and he must now address the feedback. Zhekai now needs to redouble his efforts to improve his language skills. He also needs to take some time to read the textbook/Moodle to confirm the learning from term 1.
Green,Zhekai has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Amber,"Frank is not always very attentive in class and seems to be easily distracted. Although he tends to be quiet in class discussions, his work shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Frank has achieved 70% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a very good result for this term. If he continues to pay more attention in class, and engage in personal revision of content, I am sure he will continue to make good progress."

Amber,"Frank needs to contribute more in class. He is often not paying enough attention to be able to take part in discussions. He sometimes shows he is capable of doing very well, but he needs to be more consistent and diligent. His reading, writing and listening skills all need to be improved to meet progression requirements. I suggest he use the grammar book to build up your writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. He should also attend listening and writing workshops."
Pink,Zhekai does not focus on his studies and does not participate in class. When asked direct questions he is not able to answer them. There remains some difficulty with language and this is clearly his biggest challenge. He now needs to commit to do doing the necessary work in order to pull his performance up.

Amber,"Frank - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class.

If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."

Pink,"Ozzie has all the potential to succeed but he seems to not take the class and IFY seriously. He rarely makes notes (even when I pointed out to him that he should do so), he is constantly occupied with his phone (I have asked him often to put face-down on the table but I often see him on it nevertheless), and he has an overall attitude which seems unbothered and apathetic towards the course.He needs to change this attitude."
Amber,Oguzhan is easily distracted and often does not focus in class and as a result is as disengaged in his English classes. His formative grades generally show that he needs to work much harder on improving his English learning strategies in order to ensure successful progress onto his chosen degree. He has the potential to succeed but he firstly needs to start taking greater responsibility for and show greater engagement in his own learning. In term 2 I hope to see an overall improvement in engagement. I also strongly advise him to attend writing workshops to help support his English studies.
Amber,"Oghuzan has improved this year and now engages much more in the class. His formative result shows the green shoots of some good progress. His English is adequate, but could still be improved. He now needs to build on this work by concentrating in class and reading from the book/Moodle."
Green,"Oguzhan is good student. He is increasingly more attentive in class and listens carefully to others in class discussions. I advise him to build his continue however, and contribute more regularly in class. Sharing his ideas in group discussion will enhance his critical thinking skills allowing him to shape his thinking in relation to that of his peers. Oghuzan has achieved 65% in his first formal formative assessment. He needs to now build on this success and revise harder to achieve an even higher grade, which is something he is more than capable of achieving."
Green,"After some effort on your part, I now am confident you do understand the material. Your attitude has improved overall as well. 

Although the formative assignment result was not really good, I have a feeling that the summative will greatly improve. Just show some zeal about the assignment, dedicate some time on it.

Although you will not be doing psychology at University, I can see that you have much potential in doing what you like; I hope you do not waste it due to laziness."
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Green,
Amber,"In terms of contribution and engagement, Oguzhan needs to do more to help create a more cohesive learning environment with his classmates. His summative speaking was better but his performance can be improved with more preparation and contributions; on a more positive note his listening result was pleasing, achieving 81%. He needs to work on his reading and academic writing skills and there are practice activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook to help support his English studies."
Amber,"Oguzhan often lacks involvement and commitment in class. I think that he has some talent, but he is not motivated to get involved. He must focus if he is to pass the course and go on to university."
Pink,"Oguzhan -you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to improve your listening writing skills, as well as work on your accounting.

Pink,"I believe Yi does understand the course but she is very timid and shy. I do not have any kind of information or confirmation about her ability as she has never spoke in class. I need her to start talking about her own ideas so I can be sure of her understanding. Workshop attendance is advisable, at least so she can unblock herself and be able to speak during classes."
Amber,"Yi is generally making reasonable progress and needs to continue work hard to ensure successful progression. She can be a little distracted at times and unfocused in class which impacts on her engagement and participation in class activities. Her contributions to group discussions could be improved as this will help the flow of ideas and improve the interaction between group members. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practice tasks and 2 essays and work on some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, she should attend writing workshops to help support her written skills."
Amber,"You have tried hard in Arts classes this term. However, there are some issues that you need to work on in order for you to improve. The first of these is that you need to ensure that you read the texts to prepare - without adequate preparation you will find the classes very difficult, so please try and make sure that you that you do that. The more you read texts, the easier you will find it. We can discuss aspects of your formative assignment that you can improve for next time around to ensure that you improve it for your summative work. You should also try and take a more active role in class discussion as currently you are very quiet, limiting your role to group-based work, where you are reluctant to speak English, which is detrimental to your progress. Next term, you need to work on some of these issues - but if you carry on working hard you will find things get easier!"
Amber,"Knis is a good student and always seems very positive. She works well as part of a team.  
It would be beneficial to encourage her to be more active during the class and free in expressing herself verbally."
Amber,"I believe you are an able student but you will need to improve in order to attain a progression mark. While your formative assignment mark was okay, you need to show more commitment towards studying. During our tutorial you seemed to have understood what is expected of you in your summative."
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,"Yi's summative listening grade has been disappointing although her speaking was better. She is quiet by nature, but nonetheless when it comes to pair or group work she really needs to make a bigger effort to contribute to help create a better learning experience for herself and others. Yi has been making an effort with her writing and is taking on board the feedback to help improve her marks. She should complete some reading and writing skills exercises by using the exam practice booklets included in the appendices section of the AES workbook and attend classes so that she can practise these skills and receive the necessary one-to-one feedback."
Amber,"You are exceptionally quiet in Arts, which is, at times, proving a bit problematic for your progress. Although you have the ability to do well in Arts, your reticence means that you may struggle. You need to ensure that you maintain the focus necessary for reading the texts. At times, you are distracted in group work, which means you do not get as much from it as you could. As we look ahead to the final assessment, you need to ensure you focus and participate as much as possible in classes, which will enable you to build on the feedback from your formative assignment. You have the ability to improve on this mark if you work hard!"
Amber,"Knis is a good student who shows interest in F&M as subject matter. She works very well as part of a team, but could do more in her classwork"
Amber,Yi was in the range of 60 for her Resit (S1). I believe she needs to show some more determination and attention during class and needs to do a bit more independent study as we move on in the third term. I do believe she will be able to progress with no issues if she follows my instructions.

It is strongly advised he join both listening and writing workshops."

Amber,"Zihao is very quiet in class and does not contribute to class discussions. His English is most likely holding him back from being more involved in class. Zihao now needs to focus on improving his English skills to allow him to engage more in class. His formative results were poor, but he has had some feedback so there is a chance that this will improve the summative."
Pink,Zihao needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week. He needs to be interactive during classes; he needs to attend Core Maths workshop
Amber,"Chen Zihao is a hardworking student. He listens carefully in class and is always focused on the work. He tends to be quiet in class discussions and so this is an area he could focus on more, as participating in class discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills, giving him an opportunity to form his own ideas in relation to those expressed by others. Zihao has achieved 61% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a good start. I am sure he will continue to make progress with his positive attitude. Well done!"

Pink,Keying does not participate in class discussions and is unable to answer questions when asked. I believe that this is due to her lack of english language skills and therefore she needs to increase her energy in developing her language skills.
Green,
Amber,
Pink,"Keying is a capable student and has the potential to meet her English requirements to progress onto her chosen degree providing she continues to work diligently and remains focused; she has yet to show this fully in her AES classes and exams. Her formative grades generally show that she needs to work harder on improving her level of English, particularly in listening. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading practice exams and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise her to attend listening and writing workshops to support her English studies."
Pink,Keying's confidence and attitude in class has improved. I also believe that her language skills have improved however her language skills are still at a very low level and these need to improve dramatically for her to be successful. She does not participate in class discussions and is unable to answer questions when asked. Keying now needs to redouble her efforts to pass the course and in particular improve her language skills if she has any chance of getting through successfully.
Pink,Keying is under performing in class. She must attend workshops more regularly in order to progress. I advise her to work harder in her spare time and to speak with me regularly if she is struggling to understand the work.
Amber,"Air is been more attentive in class recently. Although she tends to remain relatively quiet in class discussions, her work shows a development in her understanding of the key concepts introduced so far this term. Air achieved 65% in her first formal formative assessment, which is a good result for her for this term. I am sure that with continued focus on her work, she will make good progress."
Pink,"I feel that Keying finds English a little challenging at times, but she should perservere and work diligently to ensure she meets her English requirements to progress onto her chosen degree. It would be of great benefit if she spoke more English and did research in English and not in Mandarin as I feel this is holding her back. She should continue to work on all aspects of her English skills and reduce the amount of time speaking Mandarin in class. I strongly advise her to work on her reading skills and attend writing and listening workshops to help support his English language skills."
Pink,"Keying appears to have difficulty in class with basic understanding. She does make an effort, but it appears that her level of skill in English prevents her from being involved in any class discussion or answering questions. Her summative result was very poor. She now needs to consider if she can raise her level of english significantly in the next 3 months."
Pink,Keying is so quiet in the class. She should attend all workshops as her performance in the assessments not good and needs to work hard to progress this year. I would advise her to arrange a few personal tutorials with me to place a learning plan in her own time
Pink,"Air demonstrates some understanding and has shown some improvement in her communication skills. She tries to contribute to class discussions when she is present. she messed up her assessment where she uploaded wrong file.  which shows she needs understand and  work harder to progress, something she can certainly do. I recommend she attends workshop , as this will increase her chances of progressing."
Pink,"Keying's English results so far this term have seen mixed results. She achieved 40% for her listening, but unfortunately, her speaking result was disappointing as she achieved a score below 40%. She should continue to work on her English skills and try to speak more English and use English to do her research. I also strongly advise her to work on her reading and academic writing skills for the practice and build on her vocabulary. There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook."
Pink,Keying is still having difficulty getting involved in class work. Her level of english seems to be holding her back and this has not improved fast enough in the last 3 months. I am very concerned about Keying's ability to complete the course successfully.

Green,"Cem is a good student and has improved as a student since he joined the ISC in September. He listens carefully to others in class and focuses well, although he tends to remain relatively quiet himself in class discussions. I advise him to build his confidence and contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills.

Pink,Weilong does not participate in class and finds it difficult to answer questions in class. I am concerned that unless he develops his language skills he will not be able to complete the course.
Amber,
Pink,"BAO Weilong- Ryan shows some understanding of the subject. While in class he is attentive, at times tends to get distracted. Ryan needs to improve his focus and concentration. He should also try to answer questions in class as he lacks a bit of self-confidence. Ryan needs to work a little harder in order to make sufficient progress."
Pink,"Weilong is a capable student and has the potential to meet his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree; however, he must focus and try harder to show this fully in his AES classes and exams. He needs to start taking greater responsibility for his own English language learning, and use English as much as possible rather than Chinese to improve his level of proficiency. In term 2 I hope to see an overall improvement in engagement. During winter break he should complete all AES reading practice exams and is strongly advised to attend listening and writing workshops to help support his English language skills."
Pink,Weilong is very quiet in class. He does not appear to engage with the lesson and does not engage with class discussions. He is not able to answer questions when asked. His formative assessment result was poor and this was reflective of his general approach to the course. Weilong now needs to rapidly develop his English skills and reconfirm the learning from the first term by reading the textbook/Moodle.
Pink,Weilong is under performing in class. He must attend workshops more regularly in order to progress. I advise him to work harder in his spare time and to speak with me regularly if he is struggling to understand the work.
Amber,Ryan is a good student. He is trying to more and more to pay attention in class and focuses well when working independently or as part of a group. Ryan will sometimes contribute to class discussions and when he does it enriches the learning environment. I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly.
Pink,Weilong is a capable student and has the potential to meet his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree. His engagement in class has improved as he is trying to focus more and complete tasks to a satisfactory level. He should continue to work on all aspects of his English skills and reduce his Mandarin speaking time and carry out research in English; by not doing so is holding back his progress. I strongly advise him to work on his reading skills and attend writing workshops to help support his English language skills.

Pink,Weilong is a capable student and has every opportunity of progressing to his chosen degree. This is possible as long as he continues to apply himself to his English studies. His summative listening result has seen a marked improvement and it was felt that he could have achieved even higher in his speaking exam if he had been better prepared. I also strongly advise him to work on his reading and academic writing skills for the practice and build on his vocabulary. There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook.
Pink,Weilong does not engage in class and is often inattentive or just talking to his friends. He is going to find it difficult to complete the course unless he now focusses on his work.

Amber,
Pink,This student did not attend any of my classes. I met him briefly during a 30-minute tutorial and seems dedicated and willing to work hard to catch up with the rest of the group.
Green,
Pink,"Your exams results, apart from speaking, are concerningly low. This is also reflected in your ability to participate in class. You need to try harder to communicate in class and let me know when you need help understanding. You will need to attend the writing workshops next term as well as regularly practise your reading, writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Green,"While you are clearly an able student and apply your knowledge and skills well at times, you are easily distracted and do not always work well in groups. You should work on your behaviour for next term. Your work is good - and you have clearly progressed throughout the course of the term. Your formative assignment showed this - so well done. You should take the time to prepare well for classes. It would also be good to hear more from you as you are very quiet and rarely speak in class. If you spent a bit more time preparing and participated more in the class discussions, as well as focusing during group work, then you would see a lot of progress quickly."
Amber,Muhammad shows a lot of interest in the course. His contributions to the discussions in class are very valuable. I am confident he will make a good progress over the next months with hard work and more reading.
Amber,"Your formative was not good but you have already admitted that you did not spend time on it. I do believe you will have no problem doing good in your summative, given you commit to it. So although I was quite disappointed with your formative result, I do believe you have the potential once you commit and dedicate yourself to it."
Pink,"You sometimes try hard to participate in class but you need to make sure you do this more consistently. While your speaking and listening skills are good, I am not yet confident that you will achieve the reading and writing marks that you need to progress.  You need to attend the writing workshops regularly as well as doing reading and writing practice tests. There are also a lot of other options for self-study on Moodle. Also make sure to regularly complete your AES homework."
Pink,"While your work in class can be good, your summative assignment was problematic to say the least. You need to spend more time on your work, perhaps prioritising it more and this will require something of a change of attitude. If you start working hard, you still have a good chance of progression, but you need to start focusing with that aim in mind."
Amber,
Pink,"Saad needs to take this seriously if he is to progress. His summative result was bad. He needs to pay attention in class, take notes, in general show much more determination."
Pink,"Saad needs to contribute more in class. He needs to keep focused and always be prepared. His reading and writing grades seriously need to improve to ensure progression. To achieve this he should attend writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up his writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary as well as complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. He needs to work hard to achieve this."
Pink,"Your work in Arts has recently become quite problematic. You have the ability to progress, but there is little evidence of your application recently. You regularly come to lessons poorly prepared and while there, your behaviour leaves a lot to be desired. In order to achieve the requisite marks for progression your attitude needs to change. I also cannot comment on your formative assignment as you did not submit. This means that you will not have any feedback to work from when it comes to your summative assignment. Please attend a tutorial nonetheless so that we can discuss your progress."
Pink,"Even though in the resit for the Summative Assessment 1, Muhammad score 55% his grade remains rather low."
Pink,"Saad needs to just be more self-control over attention, concentration and participation in class, and some determination over progressing. He most definitely has the capabilities, he just has to put himself together and actually study!"

Pink,"Yintong is a capable student and has the potential to meet his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree; however, he needs to start showing this fully in his AES classes and exams. He needs to take a more proactive approach to his learning and ask questions should he need to. He needs to work more diligently and remain focused to ensure success. Over the winter break he should complete all AES reading exams and answer 2 essay questions, and in term 2 I strongly advise him to attend listening and writing workshops to help improve his English language skills."
Green,"You have made excellent progress this term - well done. Your formative assignment mark is strong, and you have started to think about texts intelligently and creatively. Your interpretation of the different texts (and the thought you have given them outside class hours) means that you are clearly developing as a student which is a delight to see. You participate well, both in seminars and in lectures. In group work, you do have a slight tendency to get a bit distracted - so be mindful of this, please. Otherwise, you have done very well indeed. Looking ahead to next term, you have plenty to build on!"
Green,"Scott demonstrates very good understanding of film and media as subject matter, as well as very good prior knowledge. He is very free and active during class, and responds well to tasks. It would be beneficial if he further invested in expressing himself more clearly and working with greater focus."
Amber,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to show a bit more commitment to studying as you have a lot of potential. 
If you improve your workload you have incredible potential. Stop being lazy."
Pink,"Yintong is a capable student and has the potential to meet his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree providing that he puts more effort into his English studies. There has been an overall improvement in his engagement in class as he is trying to focus more and complete tasks to a satisfactory level. He should continue to work on all aspects of his English skills, especially his reading and writing skills and so should attend writing workshops to help support his English language skills."
Amber,
Green,
Pink,"Scott is a bright young man who I would hate if he failed to live up to his potential because of his laziness. He needs to put more effort, attend all lectures and seminars, and in general show more determination."
Pink,"Yintong needs to dedicate more time to improving his overall English level to help him achieve the best possible grade. Unfortunately he missed his listening exam, but nevertheless he should continue to work on them by using the listening practices at the end of the AES workbook. I also strongly advise him to work on his reading skills for the practice and build on his vocabulary as well as attending writing workshops to help support his English language skills."
Pink,"You have a lot of potential in Arts, but this is currently not being realised. You are not really preparing for classes and not coming to classes with the necessary equipment. Moreover, you did not submit a formative assignment, which means you do not have the necessary feedback to build on for your summative assignment. You need to have a change of attitude in order to progress in Arts. This is still not out of your reach, but you need to ensure that you make sure that your behaviour changes soon. You need to engage fully with the course materials (as you did at the start of the course, with excellent results) to ensure that you do well in your final assessment."
Amber,"Scott is a good student who shows considerable interest in F&M as subject matter. He works well as part of team, but should put greater effort in his classwork and homework"
Pink,"The same comment said at the beginning of this term about Scott applies now as well. He needs to stop being lazy, take responsibility for himself and start studying. He has such critical thinking and attitude; it will be a pity if he does not manages to progress."

Pink,"Yufeng is hardworking and tries his best in his English studies. Although his formative grades generally show that he needs to work much harder to improve this level, particularly listening, I believe he is capable of meeting his English requirements providing he continues to work diligently and remains focused. During winter break he should work on completing all AES reading practice exams and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise him to attend listening and writing workshops to support his English studies."
Amber,"Yufeng is a very committed student and is clearly motivated. However, although he takes notes he is often unable to join in class discussions. He will attempt to answer questions when asked, but often gets these very wrong.

Yufeng needs to increase his efforts, in particular by doing follow up reading after class to reinforce the learning from the course."
Green,Yufeng has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Green,"Vincent is an attentive and hardworking student and I am very pleased with the attitude he has towards his studies. He is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. He achieved 64% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a good result for him for this term. If he now puts in some extra effort and time, I am sure he will continue to make good progress. Well done."
Pink,Yufang is harding working and I feel that he finds English a little challenging at times especially his speaking. Nevertheless he should perservere and work diligently to ensure he meets his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree. It would be of great benefit if he spoke more English and did research in English and not in Mandarin as I feel this is holding him back. He should continue to work on all aspects of his English skills and reduce the amount of time speaking Mandarin in class. I strongly advise him to work on his reading skills and attend writing and listening workshops to help support his English language skills.
Pink,Yufeng is a good student and is very committed to his studies. Unfortunately his ability in English holds him back so he has almost no ability to participate in class discussions even though he does try occasionally. He must now redouble his efforts to improve his English to give himself a chance of passing.
Green,
Amber,
Pink,Yufang continues to work very hard to improve his level of English and make a conscious effort to incorporate the advise and feedback that I give him into his work. This is paying off as he scored 40% in his listening and below 60% for his speaking. I also strongly advise him to work on his reading and academic writing skills for the practice and build on his vocabulary. There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook.
Pink,"Yufeng is a committed student and he often takes notes in class and attempts to participate in class discussions, but his level of english makes this very difficult. Yufeng appears to find some of the concepts difficult to understand and this means that it will be difficult for him to pass."
Green,He has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Amber,"Vicent - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress. However, I would recomend you attend workshop classes after Easter."

His formative grades generally show that he needs to work much harder on improving his level of English in order to progress onto his chosen degree. During winter break he should work on completing all AES reading practice exams and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise him to attend listening and writing workshops to support his English studies."
Pink,"Yuxuan is a positive student, but he does not participate in class discussions and is unable to answer questions in class when asked. His formative result was disappointing. It seems that Yuxuan's lack of skill in English is holding him back so he now needs to focus on developing himself during next term."
Green,Yuxuan has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Amber,"Robert is an able student but one who is easily distracted. He has achieved 50% in his first formal formative assessment, which is reflective of his overall performance in class. Robert must focus more and revise harder if he is to progress."
Pink,"Yuxuan is a capable student, but tends to take a very relaxed approach to class work and homework. He needs to invest more time in his English studies. I also feel that he finds English a little challenging at times especially his speaking. Nevertheless he should persevere and work diligently to ensure he meets his English requirements to progress onto his chosen degree. It would be of great benefit if he spoke more English and did research in English and not in Mandarin as I feel this is holding him back.

Amber,

Amber,
Pink,Yuxuan is a capable student and has every opportunity of progressing. This is possible as long as he applies himself to his English studies and puts more effort into it. His summative listening result has seen an improvement and it was felt that he could have achieved even higher in his speaking exam if he had been better prepared. I also strongly advise him to work on his reading and academic writing skills for the practice and build on his vocabulary. There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook.
Pink,Yuxuan appears to be losing motivation. His attendance is poor and he still does not get involved in class discussions. Neither can he answer direct questions when asked. I am concerned that unless he now commits to his studies he will not be able to complete the course.
Green,He did very well on his resit assessment. I am concern about his attendance. He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week to progress and achieves his goal.
Pink,"Robert - you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to improve your listening writing skills, as well as work on your accounting. I recommend you attend workshop classes after Easter."

Although her formative grades generally show that she needs to work much harder on improving her level of English, particularly listening, I believe she is capable of meeting her English requirements providing she continues to work diligently and remains focused. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading practice exams and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise her to attend listening and writing workshops to support her English studies."
Amber,"You have worked hard this term and it has been good to see. You take an active part in class discussion as well as a pro-active role in group work and this has meant that you have clearly developed as a student throughout the term - so well done. Your formative assignment had some good ideas in it, but there were also areas that could be significantly developed for your summative, enabling you to score more highly. You are generally conscientious, especially in lessons, but you should focus more on your attitude to preparation, ensuring that you read all the texts set. Overall, you have done a good term's work and there is much to be pleased about, and you have a solid basis for development next term."
Green,"Kira is an excellent student. She demonstrates great understanding and clear interest in film as a subject matter. She responds excellently to tasks, and always seems ready to help others. It would be good to encourage her to express herself more freely, especially verbally."
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. 

Your formative assignment was very good apart from referencing inaccuracies. You can improve on those through a bit of committment on the summative assessment."
Pink,Jingyu is hard working and tries to apply herself to class activities.  She should persevere and work diligently to ensure she meets her English requirements to progress onto her chosen degree. It would be of great benefit if she spoke more English and did research in English and not in Mandarin as I feel this is holding her back.

Pink,Jingyu is a capable student but she needs to work even harder to reach progression. This is possible as long as she continues to make the effort and apply the skills taught in class. Her summative listening results have seen a marked improvement and it was felt that she could have achieved even higher in her speaking exam if she had been better prepared. I also strongly advise her to work on her reading and academic writing skills for the practice and build on her vocabulary. There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook.
Green,"You work hard in arts and this has paid off in your formative assignment mark - so well done. You make a very good effort to participate in class and clearly try hard when you read the texts, as well as trying to interpret them independently. Your participation in class discussions as well as group work is welcome. As we look towards the final summative, there is a very solid foundation for you to build on. You should carry on working hard, as you have been, and this will enable you to do well."
Green,Kira is an excellent student who shows great interest in F&M as subject matter. She keenly does her homework and classwork and works well as part of a team
Green,Kira does have the potential for progressing. I believe she will manage to do so as she has been a dedicated student thus far. We are just in the final part of the year now and she just needs that final push to progress.

Pink,This term Mohamd has missed a number of AES classes; when present he is not always focused and can be distracted. His formative grades generally show that he needs to work much harder on improving his level of English in order to progress onto his chosen degree. He also needs to start taking greater responsibility for his own English language learning. In term 2 I hope to see an overall improvement in engagement and I strongly advise him to complete all AES reading practice exams and 2 essays and attend listening and writing workshops to help support his English studies.
Amber,Mohamd needs to be interactive during classes. He must start to contribute in classes and complete the homework to practice what we learnt in the class
Amber,"Mohamd has a good understanding, and he always participates in class but he needs to pay attention to the physics lab and develop his writing skills as his formative lab report was very week, I asked him to approach me if he is unsure how to write a good lab report."
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Mohamd's understanding of the material is quite good. Unfortunately, his test result was lower than expected. He missed quite a lot of classes and did not do his homework regularly enough. To improve the results, he needs to attend all classes and work at home between classes."
Pink,"Mohamd is still missing a number of classes and has a tendency to arrive late. his general approach to his English studies to be more serious; when in class he also needs to exercise more self-control over his phone usage. Mohamd's summative listening score has improved and now he must focus on his reading and writing skills to ensure he achieves the best score possible for progression. As said in term 1, I hope to see a continued improvement in engagement and I strongly advise him to complete reading and writing tasks as instructed."
Amber,
Amber,
Green,
Pink,"Similarly to last term, Mohamd needs to take a more serious approach to his English studies as this is affecting his overall performance and potentially his ability to progress . For his summative speaking he was disqualified; however there was a marked improvement in his listening, scoring 67%. He needs to really focus on his reading and academic writing skills for the practice as these are areas that need more attention.There are activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook."
Amber,He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week to progress.
Green,He works well in classes and has a good understanding of the subject. He needs more self-study to progress and achieves his goal.
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative and second formative assessments. 
Mohamd's result for the summative assessment was reasonably good, but the result for the formative test 2 is very low (only 40%). He missed many classes and this is not acceptable, particularly at the end of the year when we are studying more difficult topics. To improve the results, he needs to attend all classes and work at home between classes."

His formative grades generally show that his speaking skills are strong, but needs to work much harder on improving his other skills in order to progress onto his chosen degree. He has the potential to succeed but he firstly needs to start taking greater responsibility for his own English language learning. In term 2 I hope to see an overall improvement in engagement. I also strongly advise him to attend listening and writing workshops to further support his English studies."
Amber,"Ziqin has some potential, but has only recently begun to engage more fully in class. His English language skills have improved and this needs to continue for him to do well on the course. His formative result was not strong and this is not surprising as I don't think he has realised that he needs to make a real commitment to his work. Ziqin has accepted the feedback and I believe that this will make a big difference to his performance going forward."
Green,"Tom is an attentive student though he can be a little distracted at times as well. Nonetheless, his work shows that he has a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far in this term. Tom achieved 77% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a very good score and reflective of his potential. In order to maintain this, he must commit to working hard and regularly revise all his notes and classwork."
Amber,Ziqin shows a lot of interest in the course. His contributions to the discussions in class are valuable. I am confident he will make sound progress over the next few months with hard work and more reading.
Pink,There has been an overall improvement in Ziqin's performance in both his classwork and assessments. This term he seems to be more engaged in class especially in speaking and listening activities and as a result his summative results have improved. He should continue to work hard on all aspects of his English skills in order to achieve the best grade possible to reach progression. I strongly advise him to attend writing and listening workshops to support his English studies and make use of the drop-in clinic that is available to Sept students.
Amber,
Amber,
Green,
Pink,Ziqin's summative listening and speaking grades have seen an improvement and this only stands to prove that with some effort and commitment to the task/ course he can produce some pleasing results. He also needs to be more consistent in his contributions to class activities and take on board the feedback to help him improve his marks particularly his writing. He should practise listenings and complete some reading and writing skills exercises by using the exam practice booklets in the appendices section of the AES workbook and attend classes so that he can practise these skills.
Amber,"Ziqin does have some talent, but he lacks focus and motivation. At times he puts effort into his work and gets involved in class discussions, but most of the time he talks to his friends or looks at his mobile phone. His capability in english is adequate so with some effort he should be able to complete the course successfully."
Amber,"Tom - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress. You need to attend my workshop classes."
Amber,"Tom is working hard and recently produced a good presentation. He still needs to work hard at his English but he is becoming more and more confident as the year progresses. Plenty of practice speaking English will, I am confident see him improve yet further.

Tom still needs to work hard at his written work as his essays are falling a bit short of the required level. his recent submission on the global effects of the cold war, contained some good points but there were also errors but they did not generally impede the understanding or the essay.

Tom will need to work hard at being consistent in his use of capital letters and the correct tense. 

 The essay also lacked evidence of independent reading with even some of the recommended texts not used."

Although her formative grades generally show that she needs to work much harder on improving her level of English, particularly listening and reading, she must continue to work diligently and remain focused to improve her chances of meeting progression. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading practice exams and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise her to continue to attend listening workshops and attend writing workshops to further support her English studies to ensure successful progression."
Green,"Well done on an excellent term's work in Arts. Your formative assignment mark was very strong indeed, so well done. Your contributions in class are relevant and insightful. It shows that you have good grasp of the concepts and texts that we study, and can apply that knowledge, so well done. It would be good to hear more from you as you have a tendency to be on the quieter side and much of what you have to say enriches discussion considerably.  You prepare well for lessons - please persevere reading the texts! Overall, very well done - I look forward to seeing you build on this next term!"
Green,"You have worked very hard this term in Music and this has paid off with a very good formative assignment which displayed real potential. We have discussed how to take that to the next step in your tutorial and the way that you can make sure the research you have done contributes to a well-constructed argument. Your written work is strong, but you are exceptionally quiet both in groups and in class discussion. Hearing more from you would be good - and that is a priority for next term. Contributing to class discussions will stand you in good stead for university. Having heard from your instrumental teacher, it also sounds as though you also need to carry on practising hard for your recital in June - so that should be another priority. Overall you should be very pleased."
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. 
Overall you are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression."
Pink,"Nicha has made some positive progress this term and I have noticed that she is better engaged and focused in lessons. She has achieved a pleasing grade in her listening and speaking, and now needs to work on improving her summative reading and writing skills. I strongly advise her to continue to work on her listening and speaking skills as much as possible and attend writing workshops  to further support her English studies to ensure successful progression."
Amber,

Amber,"Nicha is conscientious student and there has been an overall improvement in her performance. She contributes and takes a more active role in class activities. Her summative listening and speaking results have been pleasing, particularly her listening; and now she should really focus on practising her reading and academic writing skills as these are areas that need more attention. There are practice activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook to help support her English studies."
Amber,"You work hard in Arts, but there are, at times, problems with your work. Sometimes your work is very strong, but at other times, it is much weaker, so you need to work on your consistency. You need to ensure that you engage with the texts and secondary literature so that you have strong arguments to put forward in your essays. Although you do sometimes participate, that has become less prominent recently and it would be good to hear more from you again as you have the ability to participate and valid contributions to make. Going forward, you need to focus on the consistency of your work so that you can work towards a strong mark in your summative assignment."
Amber,"Your work in music is very good, showing that you understand the main aspects of the course. You remain very quiet in class though - and there is little reason for this, as you are perfectly capable of engaging in class discussion. Looking ahead to next term, you should continue to work hard, focusing both on your participation and your writing so that you can score highly in the written part of your second summative assignment. You should also make sure that you practise hard for your recital."
Amber,Pat is almost there. She just needs a bit more effort and she will be getting her progression mark. She obviously has the capabilities for it. Given she shows the adequate passion and determination she will be progressing.

Amber,"You have worked hard this term so well done. Your assignment was good, but there are areas in which you could have improved it - so we will discuss that in your tutorial. You do sometimes contribute in classes but you could really build on your work in small groups (which is good) and start contributing more in class discussions. You should also work more on preparing texts so that you are more able to comment on the specifics of the texts. However, you have tried hard this term so you have much to be pleased about."
Green,"Ain is a very good student and always seems very positive. She demonstrates curiosity and clear interest in film as subject matter. She responds to tasks readily, although with some insecurity. She could be further encouraged to speak up more freely."
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. 
Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this.
You have the capabilities for much higher marks."

Amber,Ain is a capable student but needs to apply herself a little more to her English students. Her summative listening and speaking grades have seen an improvement and this only stands to prove that with some effort and commitment to the task she can produce some pleasing results. Ain should really focus on practising her reading and academic writing skills as these are areas that need also need to be worked on. There are practice activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook and she should make use of the drop-in clinics to help support her English studies
Amber,"You work hard in Arts, showing that you try to engage both with the texts and also with class discussions. This gives you a strong foundation for your work next term. You should try and build on this, ensuring that you continue to participate in class - and that you continue to read the texts (something that you don't always find easy). You should also try and ensure that you engage with sufficient secondary literature for your assignments. Overall, you should be pleased as if you take the feedback on your assignment into account and you continue to work hard, you have the ability to do well in your final assignment."
Green,Ain is an excellent student who shows great interest in F&M as subject matter. She keenly does her homework and classwork and works well as part of a team
Amber,Ain needs to do a bit more in terms of her progression. Her Resit mark was in the range of 50 so she still needs something more for her S2. She needs to do much more independent study and pay much more attention during class.

Pink,"You have been a good student in class and have tried hard to understand what we have studied. However, your listening, writing and reading exam results are concerning. You must attend the listening workshop next term and regularly practise your reading, writing and listening skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle; for example, completing the listening videos with questions can help you prepare for Part 2 of the AES exam. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book."
Pink,"You have worked hard this term, even when you have found aspects of the course difficult - so well done. Carry on persevering - it will get easier! You are very quiet indeed in class - it would be nice to hear from you in class discussion: you do have things  to say, but are reluctant to voice them. If you are worried about speaking in a lecture, try first in a seminar. You work well in groups, which is good to see, but you need to ensure that you take the next steps of participating more actively. The difficulties of the texts are clear, but you need to carry on trying hard! We will discuss difficulties you may have had with your formative assignment, enabling you to improve for your summative. Overall, you should be pleased with how hard you have worked this term."
Amber,Yume is a good and curious student. She responds readily to all the tasks and always seems very positive. It would be beneficial to encourage her to be more active during the class and free in expressing herself verbally.
Amber,"Your formative assignment was not that good and you will need to improve on the summative to attain a progression mark. After our tutorial, I am confident you understood what went wrong. I am confident you can achieve progression, given you concentrate a bit more on what is requested of you and commit yourself a bit more."
Amber,
Amber,
Green,
Pink,"Yume needs a bit more effort. She needs to take more responsibility towards the improvement of her English language skills (writing, reading, speaking). Once her English language level is improved, her academic progression would be of no issue."
Pink,"Yume is a keen and attentive member of the class. She contributes well and asks when she needs help. Her writing, reading and listening grades all need to improve to ensure progression to his next chosen course. To achieve this she should attend listening and writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up her writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary and regularly listen and complete all of the practice tests in the AES books."
Green,"Hard work in Arts is really starting to pay off for you, so well done! You show evidence of trying hard in class and clearly try to engage with the texts. Your formative assignment mark was both evidence of this hard work and a very good basis for your summative assignment. It will be possible for you to work with this feedback as you look ahead to next term so that you achieve a good mark in your summative assignment. Carry on reading the texts carefully and try to build on your engagement with secondary literature to give your arguments weight for good results."
Green,"Yume is a good student who shows considerable interest in F&M as subject matter. She works very well as part of a team, and meaningfully contributes to classwork"
Pink,Yume is a dedicated student and she has put a lot of effort throughout the year. Her level of English had been low when she entered the course but it has improved. She should try to do her best nevertheless towards the last exam.

All the work she had produced this term has been of very high quality and clearly showed she has a very firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and is more than capable of putting them into practice.  Provided Sara continues working with the same level of dedication and integrity, I have no doubts whatsoever that her summative results will be of an equally high standard. During the Winter Break, Sara should start working on the AES research project so that she can get started on CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Pink,Sara is underperforming in class. She must attend workshops more regularly in order to progress. I advise her to work harder in her spare time and to speak with me regularly if she is struggling to understand the work.
Green,You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. Keep doing what you are currently doing.  Your knowledge of the subject is excellent and you show dedication for the subject as well.

Green,"Sara's hard work this term seems to have really paid off as all her AES results to date came in at a distinction level or above. She is attentive in class and open to advice on how to improve her work further, which means her skills are constantly developing and her (already very good) written work is constantly improving. With such attitude, Sara is on a clear road to success and, should she continue working as hard as she did in Term 2, I have no doubt whatsoever that she will meet and exceed all her progression requirements. During her Spring break, Sara should concentrate on completing her CW 3."
Green,She works well in classes and has a good understanding of the subject. She needs more self-study to progress and achieves her goal.
Green,One of the best students in this cohort. Very well done.

Green,Hoi Lam has achieved excellent grades in formative assessments this term.  She has demonstrated a considerable willingness to contribute to class discussion and an ability to support peers in their learning by asking questions and seeking clarification on matters that have seemed confusing.  In the coming months it may be helpful for Hoi Lam to engage in more focussed vocabulary extension activities to enable her to utilise a greater range of expression and to fully demonstrate clear subject specific knowledge about key topics.  Completing vocabulary exercises on Moodle and more extensive reading could be helpful in achieving this goal.
Pink,Hoi Lam needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think she is putting in the required effort for the course. She should do self-study every week. She needs to be interactive during classes
Green,You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. Keep doing what you are currently doing. Your knowledge of the subject is excellent and you show dedication for the subject as well.

She has demonstrated a high level of commitment to AES study and always engages enthusiastically in whatever is being studied in class.  In the remaining weeks of the AES course, it may be helpful for Hoi Lam to focus on skills required to pass the reading and writing exam at a similar level to that demonstrated in speaking and listening; utilising practice material available on Moodle and exam practice papers in the AES Workbooks."
Amber,She is very quiet in class. She needs to work hard to progress this year. I would advise her to arrange a few personal tutorials with me to place  a learning plan in her own time

Pink,"While Rishi is clearly a very bright and intelligent young man with immense academic potential, he has not contributed much in class during the course of Term 1. He has shown very little willingness to engage in group activities or collaborate with his classmates and has, on many occasions, explicitly refused to follow instructions or accept explanations provided. This has affected his ability to complete academic writing tasks correctly and has resulted in a very disappointing mark for his formative AES writing exam. If Rishi wants to progress to his chosen degree at Royal Holloway, he needs to achieve a score of 70% or more in writing and in order to do so he must start taking a more active part in class activities and learn to follow academic writing style conventions."
Green,"Your work in Arts has been very good. You think creatively and have applied that to texts throughout the term. Sometimes you have prepared well, other times not so well - it would be good to see your approach to this become more consistent so that you are always preparing well. However, you do not always participate in class and have struggled at times to work constructively in groups. This is definitely something for you to work on next term. It would be good to hear more from you in seminars and lectures as this is something of which you are most definitely capable. Overall, you have worked well this term, but it would be beneficial to see you trying harder to work with other people next term as you can learn a lot from conversation with others."
Green,"Rishi is an independent, creative and very engaged student. He responds excellently to tasks, is very active in class and ask original questions. It would be beneficial if he allowed more space for team work."
Green,"Mr. Rishi has all the potential in the world. A very intelligent and critical individual who always os ready to discuss whatever subject we might be discussing about during our seminars. 
He will need however to commit a bit more to academic writing and the logistics that are expected of him to progress."
Green,
Amber,
Green,
Green,
Pink,"While certainly intelligent and capable, Rishi tends to ignore, or in some cases point blank refuses to follow, assessment instructions and procedures. In term 2, this attitude had a significant negative impact on his summative CW1 results, as he seems not to have read the assignment brief and thus failed to meet most task requirements for this assessment. It is strongly advised that Rishi re-submits this work in Term 3 resit sessions and, in the future, takes greater care to ensure he follows assessment instructions. Should he struggle to understand them, he needs to speak to his tutor or come to a drop-in clinic to seek further guidance. Rishi is a very good writer, but should ensure he structures his work appropriately and follows appropriate academic conventions. He makes valid contributions to class discussions but his attitude towards his peers can, at times, leave something to be desired."
Green,"You are a very bright and capable student: of this I have no doubt. However, your application of your abilities in the classroom is less consistent. While I know that your summative mark was a disappointment to you, your second formative was stronger and shows that you have a very strong foundation to work with. However in order for you to be successful, you need to continue to engage with the course. We have already discussed this briefly, but it would be good to see you do this in a sustained manner over the next term as this is most likely to lead to success. If you read the texts and look at both primary and secondary sources, then you have the ability to do very well in your second summative, as long as you work hard and engage well in lessons."
Green,Rishi is an excellent student who shows great creativity and interest in F&M as subject matter. He works well as part of a team and contributes to the class debates
Green,"Undoubtedly, Rishi will be progressing. I just want to say nonetheless that he possesses one of the most critical minds I have ever tought. I am proud to have had him as my student."

Pink,"Ade is a bright and charismatic young man who makes valuable and interesting contributions to all class discussions. Having said that, however, he gets very easily distracted by both technology and his fellow classmates and, as a result, often fails to pay sufficient attention to instructions and explanations given in class. Consequently, he frequently fails to complete tasks on time and/or does not complete them appropriately. This is reflected in his formative AES results which are well below what we would expect of a student of his level of proficiency. Writing is a particular area of concern at this moment in time, as both the formative writing exam and the homework that Ade did submit in the course of Term 1 indicate his writing skills are well below the level required to progress to the degree of his choice. It is thus imperative that Ade spends his winter break revising Term 1 materials and, once he's back in the centre in January, starts attending writing workshops."
Green,"Your work this term has been very good, so well done. You are capable of and do make intelligent, insightful and creative contributions to class discussions (both in lectures and seminars). Recently, you have had a bit of a change in your attitude for the better, which has been a welcome development - please keep this up. It means you get a lot more from classes. In group work, you sometimes get caught up in socialising rather than the task at hand - keep an eye on this. Your formative assignment was good, but showed some areas for development so that you can ensure you receive a stronger mark next time. Looking ahead to next term, try and take a more active role in lecture-based discussion as this is a natural next step for you. You should also ensure that you are on top of your preparation for the classes."
Amber,"Ade is very free and active during class, shows clear interest in film and asks original and interesting questions. It would be beneficial if he invested more in his written assignments as he seems to struggle in keeping focus on written or slow-paced tasks."
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class. Sociology seems to have drawn your atttention and you always have comments about the subjects we discuss in class.
A bit more commitment by you can make wonders. Concentrate more in class and try to participate more during our discussions. 
And stop caring so much about your mobile phone and your hair!"
Green,
Green,

Green,
Amber,"Ade's class participation this term has been exemplary - he has done his student-led seminar to a very high standard and made interesting and insightful contributions to discussions led by his colleagues. Ade has also done very well in his summative listening and speaking exams achieving scores above distinction level for both. His research skills, however, still require some improvement and his summative coursework 1 showed work below his potential. I would thus suggest Ade spends some time during his Spring break on revising credibility criteria and looking for more academically appropriate sources to support his work in CW2 and CW3 and thus maximise his chances of meeting progression requirements for his chosen degree."
Green,"Your attitude in arts has changed for the better which is really good to see. When you work hard in arts this leads to good participation in class discussions, and you have started working much better in groups as well. There is, therefore, much that you should be pleased about this term. Your formative assignment mark gives you a strong basis to build on for your summative assignment next term if you continue to work hard. Making sure you continue to read the texts, as well as consulting some secondary literature (which has been something of a problem for you so far), will mean that you are in a good position to do well."
Amber,Ade is a good student who shows some interest in F&M as subject matter. He works well individually but demonstrates limited understanding for the merits of team work
Green,"Mr Ade will be progressing. In addition, he has the capabilities to achieve great things if he just take studying seriously. While a brilliant and critical young man, he often comes across as an ""immature lad""; he is much more than that."

Her results in listening, reading, writing and speaking assessments have been outstanding, and the attitude she has demonstrated to learning in class has been diligent and respectful. Over the coming months it may be helpful for Marya to engage in more focussed vocabulary extension activities to enable her to utilise an even greater range of expression and to fully demonstrate subject specific knowledge about key topics.  Completing vocabulary exercises on Moodle and more extensive reading could be helpful in achieving this goal."
Green,Very good knowledge and works well during classes. Please keep this good effort up.
Green,Marya has a good knowledge of physics and a good understanding of the topics. She works hard in the lab to get accurate data and results. Please keep this up.
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Marya always pays attention and is working relatively well in class. She submitted a few homework assignments, but then stopped. Her test result was not very good, so she needs to work more between classes: read about the new materials, practice at home. Please ask questions if something is unclear. I also think that Maria would benefit from attending Maths workshops."

Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test. Marya attendance is great. She is doing her homework as well, but I am not sure whether or not she is looking at my comments and correct her mistakes. Unfortunately her result in the recent test was much lover that expected. We need to work more in order to prepare for the test resit. I hope she will start to attend Maths workshops regularly and always ask questions if something is unclear."
Green,"Marya has produced some good written work over the last few weeks and is clearly able to structure text in an appropriately academic style.  She demonstrated a high level of clarity and coherence in the summative seminar assessment, and has shown admirable commitment to her studies in AES generally.  Marya’s first summative listening result was highly commendable.  In the remaining weeks of the AES course, it may be helpful for Marya to focus on skills required to pass the reading and writing exam at a similar level to that demonstrated in speaking and listening, utilising practice material available on Moodle."
Green,She works well in classes and has a good understanding of the subject. She needs to be calm in the exam as she is not getting the mark that she deserves
Green,"Marya has extensive knowledge of physics and works very well during classes, and her first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up."
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative and second formative assessments.
I am worried about Marya's results. She is attending and working in class well, but she is not doing any work at home and this could be dangerous. She needs to practice more between classes. I also strongly recommend her to attend Maths workshop."

Your exam results were satisfactory but you especially need to improve your writing skills. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle and you can use the grammar book to help as well. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book with the writing questions after them."
Pink,"Min does appear to have some talent, but has missed a significant number of classes this term and this is shown in his poor formative result. His English language skills are adequate, but he does not engage in class discussions and he finds it difficult to answer questions when asked. He now needs to make sure his attendance is high, address the feedback from the formative and focus on his studies if he is to make progress this year."
Green,Min Gi has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Green,"Kim Min Gi is a good student. He tries to listen hard in class and focus on what is being delivered, showing himself to be an attentive student whether that is when he is working independently or as part of a group. Min Gi needs to continue contributing to class discussions, as when he does it enriches the learning environment. Min Gi has achieved 68% in his first formal formative assessment and I hope he will continue to make progress with his positive attitude."

Amber,Min Gi has turned himself around since term 1. He has refocussed himself and is now much more committed to his studies. He is engaged in class and participates fully. As long as this continues he is very likely to pass.

She contributes well and takes an active role in class activities showing a good level of criticality – keep up the good work. An area that could also be improved on is her listening and so greater practice will see improvements in this skill. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE to support her English studies."
Green,"Overall, you have worked very hard this term and it shows. You have much to be pleased about: your participation in class - both seminars and lectures - is excellent. You prepare well for my classes and you show an ability to think both intelligently and creatively about texts. Your formative assignment mark was not as strong as might have been expected, but you have plenty of time to improve and some of the issues with it were not large (as we will discuss at our tutorial). You work well in groups as well. Your enthusiasm for the subject is infectious - thank you. You can be positive looking ahead to next term!"
Green,Syafiqah is an excellent student. She responded excellently to all the tasks (including the first formative assessment) and demonstrates great understanding as well as clear interest in film as a subject matter.
Green,"You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. Keep doing what you are currently doing.Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this. After our tutorial, it was made clear what more is required of you in terms of the assignment and I am confident you will be able to produce this.You have the capabilities for much higher marks."
Amber,

Green,
Pink,"While the student is more than able in terms of language skills and general knowledge, she has not shown the determination able to carry her forward. She needs to commit to studying, focus on her assignment and show more determination. Once she does that, I am certain she will succeed."
Amber,"Syafiqah is a capable student, but has become distracted part way through the term. Although she missed her summative listening, her summative speaking grade shows that she is articulate and is able to communicate some complex ideas. As long as she continues to make the effort and apply the skills taught in class I am sure she'll do well in her studies. She needs to stay focused and work hard to reach progression and I strongly advise her to work on her reading and academic writing skills for the practice, and complete activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook."
Green,"You perform well in Arts classes and clearly make the effort to prepare. However, there are potential problems for your ongoing progress. You did not submit a formative assignment, which means you do not have the feedback to work on for your second summative in June. While you clearly care about your results on the course, you need to ensure that you focus the appropriate aspects of the course so that you achieve the marks necessary to progress. We will discuss this further in your tutorial. You are most definitely capable of progressing - you just need to ensure you stay on track so that this happens."
Amber,Syafika is a good student who shows some interest in F&M as subject matter. She works well individually but demonstrates limited understanding for the merits of team work
Amber,"Syafiqah missed her Formative 2 so I do not have a clear idea of her knowledge in Sociology. In addition, she has been absent for a large part of Term 2 which has affected her knowledge and understanding of some concepts. While we have done a couple of tutorials together, now is the time for her to concentrate and decide whether she is up for progressing and studying in University. She most definitely has the potential; it would be a pitty if she does not live up to it."

Pink,Xin preliminary test result is quite low. Unfortunately there is a clash in the timetable and student could not attend the Maths workshop. It is necessary to do extra work between classes and ask questions is something is unclear.
Amber,
Pink,"Luke has made little progress in listening and writing, which need extra effort to improve because his scores are below the 40% progression requirement for his chosen degree. Participating more in class, doing extensive listening and writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are all likely to improve chances of progression. He may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis. Luke should also ensure to complete homework after class."
Amber,"Xin does not participate in class discussions and is not able to answer questions when asked. However, he does appear to be concentrating on the lesson. His language skills are a challenge for him so he now has an opportunity to focus on developing his english skills that will enable him to complete the course more effectively."
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Xin's attendance was good, but the first formative test result is very poor (18%).  Unfortunately Xin is not able to attend the Maths workshop because of the clash with another class. Xin definitely needs more help, we need to think how it could be organised after the Easter holiday. More work is required!"
Pink,"Luke - you joined the ISC late and while you do engage and answer questions when asked, you also seem to be easily distracted. You need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should enghage in self-study every week, and practice your writting. You need to attend workshop after Easter, especially as your score for your recent assessment was 37."
Pink,"Luke picks up new ideas quickly and works hard in class. His seminar skills and written work are now improved. Nevertheless, given the high entry requirements from RHUL, he needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on Moodle are likely to improve chances of progression."
Pink,"Xin is quite passive in class. He has ample opportunity to ask questions and get involved in class discussions, but he does not. I am concerned that if Xin does not improve his commitment he is at risk of failing the course."
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Xin got the result just above 40%.  He needs to attend the classes and Maths workshop  regularly  to prepare for the resit of S1 test."
Pink,"Luke joined the IFY course late and has struggled to catch up since. His attendance is irregular, and though at the start of this new term he is better, he still needs to do work hard to progress. He needs to improve his writing skills. He needs to pay more attention in class too and keep up with the work both in class and outside of class. I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should engage in self-study every week."
Amber,"Luke shows a good learning attitude and actively contributes to all class discussions. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. His reading and writing skills, however, need further development.  I would also advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to maximise his chances of progression. He is also advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard."
Pink,"Xin still lacks participation in class. He also has patchy attendance. His summative 1 result was good so there is a chance that he can succeed on the course. However, the second assessment is not a written piece of work and he did not complete the formative."
Pink,Xin was unable to complete much of the statistics mock S2 test but has been finding solutions to more problems over the last few weeks which will improve his chance of reaching a respectable grade.
Pink,"He Xin - You need to improve your attitude towards studies, you need to attend my classes more regularly and consistently. Your absences will make it harder for you to successfully pass this subject, and you cannot rely entirely on using resources of Moodle alone to always catch up. You score for formative 2 assessment is 22% is very low, and this will be challenge  progressing to your chosen degree . I recommend you attend all workshops and do not miss anymore classes."

Pink,"Vivian is a friendly quiet student who participates well in class showing a good understanding of the material covered when present. However, she needs to be  engaging more actively in class. Listening needs further development  as she barely passed the recent mock exam.  Doing extra listening practice from TED Talks as well as the independent study materials on Moodle is highly recommended in order to develop listening skills and maximise chances of receiving a higher mark in this subskill."
Amber,

Pink,English proficiency needs to be improved to reach progression.
Pink,"Vivian demonstrates a good learning attitude. Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as she has scored below 70% in her writing assessment to date, which is far below the writing requirement for her chosen degree. Attending listening and writing workshops, being participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Amber,"Vivienne is a good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. She takes part in group discussions and all the classwork, but seems somewhat reserved and shy"
Amber,"Vivian is very quiet in class and struggles to join in on class discussions. Despite this however, her written work shows that she is listening and trying to apply herself. I am confident that Vivian has the ability to pass, and potentially progress from the Foundation Year to the first year of her undergraduate studies. I would advise Vivian to try and be a little more vocal in class, especially as the final assessment for Film and Media is a presentation."
Pink,Zhihui's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a limited knowledge of sociology. I advise to get more involved in class discussions and to allocate more time for independent study.

Amber,"Vivian is a hard-working and conscientious student. She will sometimes contribute to the class discussions. I'd advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. She has also handed all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to maximise her chances of progression."
Pink,"Vivienne is reluctant to participate in class, though she is more capable than she believes.It would be good to see her show that she has prepared for class by taking a more active role in class discussions. Her recent formative result was a bit disappointing so she should attend her tutorial ready to discuss next steps so that she can be successful in her final assignment at the end of the term. Overall, there is some good work, but she can do more."
Amber,Vivian is a conscientious student who has potential to do very well. My only concern is that she needs to practice her presentation skills a little more to ensure that she performs well in her S2.
Amber,"Vivian is an able student but needs to revise more and practice her use of sociological terminology. Overall, I am confident she can do well in this subject, but it will not come without some serious effort and practice."

Amber,"Man Nok has shown consistency and dedication this term in her class attendance and participation.  Formative assessment results in listening, reading and seminar skills have been encouraging, but there is considerable room for improvement in the writing skills demonstrated.  It may be beneficial to review all of the material covered in Term 1 classes in order to fill knowledge gaps in relation to text structure and citation in academic writing.  It will also be a requirement for Man Nok to attend writing workshops in Term 2 to enable her to reach the required standard to pass the AES course."
Amber,"Overall, you have worked hard this term so well done. I suspect your formative assignment mark has come as something of a disappointment, but there are aspects of it that can easily be improved.  You work well in groups and are conscientious, preparing well for lessons. You are not very vocal in classes and rarely contribute in seminars (and never in lectures). You have the capability to make interesting contributions so it would be good to hear your voice more. Generally, you should be pleased about this term's work and see it as a basis to improve next term."
Green,"You have worked hard in music this term - so well done. You have done very well in the formative assignment which is a result of that work - so this has set you up very well for the terms ahead. You work well in class, especially in group work. At times you are a little quiet in class, relying on others to speak for you: it would be good instead to hear from you directly. You have valuable contributions to make, so it would be good to hear them! This is definitely something you should focus on next term. Overall, you should be very pleased with the foundations you have laid this term."
Green,"Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this.
You have the capabilities for much higher marks. 
A bit more commitment and you can achieve higher marks 100%."
Pink,"Man Nok has achieved good grades in listening, reading and seminar assessments on the AES course, but her writing is a cause for some concern.  In order to develop the requisite skills to achieve a higher writing grade, I would strongly recommend that Sharon attends writing workshops and revises the AES lesson input from Term 1 which particularly focussed on how to structure academic texts.  Revision of the form and function of basic grammar structures, using the Oxford Grammar for EAP textbook, could also be beneficial."
Green,
Green,
Amber,
Amber,"Man Nok achieved relatively good results in her speaking seminar and summative listening assessment at the beginning of Term 2, but there is scope for further improvement.  In order to develop her reading and writing skills in coming weeks, and to gain higher results in summative assessments in Term 3, it may be helpful to review the independent study material which is available on Moodle, and to work through the practice exam material in the back of the AES Workbooks.  It might also be beneficial for Man Nok to review some of the language units in the Oxford EAP textbook."
Green,"You work hard in Arts and this is paying off. You understand the need for solid preparation and this is showing in your ability to take part in group work in class. You are much quieter in class than I might expect though, which is a shame as you have interesting contributions that you could make, so it would be good to hear more from you. Your formative assignment mark was very good, showing the results of your hard work, so the next step is for you to build on this with greater participation and this should lead to a good mark in your summative assignment."
Green,"You have always worked hard in music, but recently it has become possible to see the results of this in class. You are participating more and your contributions are intelligent and insightful, showing that you understand the topics at hand and have grasped the theoretical aspects of the course. Looking ahead to next term, you should continue to work hard in lessons, as well as practising for your recital as this will enable you to do well in your second summative assignment."
Amber,Sharon has all the potential to progress and will do so given she studies prior to her exam. I have no worries at this level for the student as I believe she will be able to attain a mark to help her progress with just a bit more effort on her part..

Pink,"Federico has made little progress this term. His listening and writing skills, in particular, need further development, as he has scored below 40% in his listening and writing assessments, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are all likely to improve chances of progression. He may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Pink,"Jiajin is an unusual student in that he is language skills are very poor, but he is still able to maintain motivation and work on the material. From time to time he tries to ask questions (mostly unsuccessfully) and this is very good. However, he has a long way to go to develop his language skills and this will be his main challenge on the course."
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Jiajin missed some classes and his first formative test result is not very good (41%).  Unfortunately Jiajin was not able to attend the Maths workshop because of the clash with another class. To improve the Maths level I recommend to attend the workshop and practice between the classes by solving extra exercises."
Amber,"Federico - you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to improve your listening writing skills, as well as work on your accounting. I recommend you attend workshop classes after Easter."
Pink,"Federico picks up new ideas quickly. His writing and listening skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. He may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Pink,"Jiajin does try to engage with the material, but his English skills remain poor. He is making some progress, which is positive, but I am concerned that it is not fast enough. He now needs to focus on improving his English rapidly if he is to gain progression to his undergraduate studies."
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Jiajin got the result just above 40%. I am glad that Jiajin is attending classes and Maths workshop. Please continue your good work. I am hopeful that you will have better results for the resit of S1 test."
Pink,"Fedrico needs to attend classes more regularly, and pay greater attention to what is being covered in our sessions so as to have notes from which she can revise. I do not think she is putting in the required effort for the course and would advise her to turn this around."
Pink,"Federico listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. He also contributes well to class discussions and demonstrated good speaking skills. However, he has made limited progress in listening, reading and writing (including grammar), which need extra effort to improve. He is advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard. Attending writing workshops is still recommended. Attending all workshops, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve his chances of progression."
Pink,"Jiajin remains of some concern to me. His engagement levels have not increased and his participation in class remains poor. In order for him to be successful he now needs to make a serious commitment to his learning. He needs to review the material from term 1, focus on english skills and participate in lessons with much more energy."
Pink,Jiajin achieved a pass grade in his recent mock statistics S2 test but received a very good result in the formative 2 exam.  If he ensures he practises sufficient problems to understand the concepts he has the ability to improve on the mock result in the final exam.
Pink,"Feddrico - Your attitude is improved in class but you need to attend my classes more regularly and consistently. Your absences will make it harder for you to successfully pass this subject, and you cannot rely entirely on using resources of Moodle alone to always catch up. Your formative 2 score is 46 %assessment, you need to improve make the challenge of progressing to your chosen degree harder. I recommend you attend all workshops and do not miss anymore classes."

Pink,Xiaowen does not participate in class discussion and is unable to answer direct questions when asked. Her level of english needs to be developed in order for her to make the most of the classes and therefore progress.
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Xiaowen attendance is good, but the result for the first formative test could be better (55%).  Further improvement is required. I recommend to  practice more by solving extra exercises at home and attending the workshop."
Amber,"Pan -  You are very quiet in the class, but when a question is asked of you directly, you demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the subject. You need to  improve on your confidence. Additionally, your writing needs to improve too. I see you have the potential to progress, and I recommend you attend the workshop next term."

Pink,"Xiaowen continues to lag behind the necessary standard. Her summative 1 was acceptable, but overall her english needs to improve if she is to progress. In order to do this she needs to focus on her studies and engage fully with classes."
Amber,Xiaowen was unable to achieve a pass grade in the mock statistics S2 test and must continue to practise problem solving in order to improve this grade.  The language of statistics has caused some issues but she must learn to look beyond the text and work with the numbers.
Amber,"Pan - You are a pleasure to teach, you certainly impressed me. Please be aware though that there is always room for improvement and this is what you should be concentrating on – stretching you knowledge and understanding. Your formative 2 score is 99% and this is a very good result. If you can achieve something similar, or even higher in your summative 2, you need to concentrate on writing skill, if you can do well indeed and be able to progress to RH without much difficulty"

Pink,Jiebiao has made no impact in class and this appears to be as a result of lack of skill in English. In order to make progress on the course as the content becomes more complex he now needs to develop these skills as a priority.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Jiebiao is a strong student, his maths level is very good. He got very good result in his formative test. No worries whatsoever."

He needs to focus on his studies if he is to have any chance of progressing. He needs to review the term 1 material to ensure his understanding and he also needs to dramatically improve his skill in english if he is to succeed on the course."
Green,"Jiebiao had an excellent result in the formative 2 test but this was not reflected in the statistics mock S2 test in which a pass grade was not achieved.  He must continue to practise problem solving and ensure a good understanding of the rules, tables and formulae to achieve a comparable result in the S2 exam."

Amber,"Jiarui has grown her confidence during this year, but she still remains weak in terms of spoken english. Her summative 1 result was good/acceptable, but she will need to maintain high levels of concentration in order to complete the rest of the course successfully."
Amber,Jiarui did not achieve a pass grade in the statistics mock S2 test and found the language of statistics a problem.  More independent problem solving and an improved ability to work with the numbers rather than the text will help.

Amber,Whilst Zhiyuan does appear to be engaged in the class he does not participate in class discussions and is not able to answer questions when asked directly. This appears to be due to his lack of language skills in english. He now needs to redouble his efforts to improve his language skills so that he can progress.
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Zhiyuan missed a few classes. This could be the reason why his formative test result was lower than the preliminary test result. Student is on track but still needs more effort to progress to the degree."

Pink,Zhiyuan's attendance is poor and when he does attend class he makes little effort to participate in the class. I think that this is due to his lack of skill in English. The second summative is a presentation so it is likely that this will present him with a significant challenge. He now needs to focus his attention on his studies in order to successfully progress to university.
Green,Zhiyuan is confident of his ability to achieve a good grade but did not attend the statistics S2 mock test.  He does however work hard in class and supports his peers.

Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to maximise his chances of progression."
Amber,"Jiawei has improved his confidence considerably during the year. However, he still has a long way to go to become confident in english. He seems to have some understanding of the topics, but his summative 1 result was disappointing so he needs to spend time reviewing the taught material and doing some wider reading. He also needs to develop his skill in English which is still of some concern."
Amber,Jiawei was unable to achieve a pass grade in the recent statistics mock S2 test and must ensure a sound understanding of the basic concepts covered.  Continued practise on problem solving will support this and improve the ability to read beyond the language.
Pink,"Clifford - Your attitude is improved  in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 84%, please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score in writing. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills and practice revision questions, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result. You need to work hard to progress to RH"

Pink,"Sophia is a friendly quiet student who participates well in class showing a good understanding of the material covered when present. However, she needs to be more actively engaged in class. Listening needs further development  as she barely passed the recent mock exam .  Doing extra listening practice from TED Talks as well as the independent study materials on Moodle is highly recommended."
Amber,
Green,
Amber,
Pink,"Sophia demonstrates a good learning attitude. Her listening and writing skills, however, needs further developments as she has scored well below 40% in her listening assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Participating more in class, attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Amber,King Yi does not participate in class discussions and is unable to answer questions when asked. It seems that her english language skills need to be developed further for her to be able to participate in the course. She now has an opportunity to throw herself into her language studies to really develop her skills that she will need to complete the course.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Shiting attendance and work in class is very good as well as her formative test results. She shows an interest in the subject and understanding towards the course in general. No worries whatsoever."
Amber,"Shiting - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."
Amber,
Pink,Shiting does seem to pay attention in class and her summative 1 was reasonably good. She now needs to improve her focus by 10% to give herself that last little push towards progression.
Green,
Amber,
Amber,"Sophia is a hard-working and conscientious student. She will sometimes contribute to the class discussions. I would advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. She has also handed all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to maximise chances of progression."
Pink,"Shiting continues to make little impact in class. Her confidence is improving, but her language skill remains very limited and this will put her success on the course at risk. Her summative 1 result was relatively good so this gives me some hope for the rest of the course."
Green,The language of statistics is not easy and Shiting was unable to achieve a pass grade in the recent statistics mock S2 exam.  However she has been working hard to improve her understanding through practise.
Amber,"Shiting - Your attitude is good in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 82%, , please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score.

Pink,"Cassie demonstrates a good learning attitude. Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as she has scored below 40% in her listening assessment, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Her writing score is also well below the writing requirement of her chosen degree. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Green,Cassie is an excellent student who shows great interest in Arts as subject matter. She is also very keen in helping others in their classwork
Amber,"Cassie is generally quiet in class and avoids joining in on class discussions. Despite this however, her written work shows that she is listening and trying to apply herself. I am confident that Cassie has the ability to pass and  progress from the Foundation Year to the first year of her undergraduate studies. I would advise Cassie to try and be a little more vocal in class, especially as the final assessment for Film and Media is a presentation. She could do well to practise the skills of presentation to ensure she achieves the best grade possible."
Amber,"Kaiyuan's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects an adequate knowledge of sociology and hard work. Despite being very quiet during the seminar discussions, she turned in a good assignment. I recommend to get more involved in the class discussions and to allocate more time for independent study in order to gain depth of knowledge and to improve your critical skills."
Pink,"Cassie has shown her potential in the recent summative assessments. Nevertheless, given the high entry requirements from RHUL, she needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on Moodle are likely to improve chances of progression."
Pink,"Cassie is an attentive student who tries hard in lessons and displays commitment to her studies. Unfortunately, her first summative assignment was not entirely successful, which was the reason for this grade. However, the main problems with that assignment would be easy for her to address with a subsequent attempt and thus she would easily get back on track. Contributing more to class discussion would help build Cassie's confidence."
Green,
Amber,
Pink,"Cassie tends to be focused on the content and shows a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. However, her overall grades are well below the overall English language requirement for her chosen degree. She should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. She is advised to hand all of her homework in to a high standard. Attending writing workshops is still recommended. Attending listening workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Cassie is a dedicated student who shows that she is trying hard. This was particularly in evidence with her summative resit, which was a successful assignment, though there are still places in which she can improve. Her formative assignment was problematic because it showed a flawed understanding of the question, but the underlying work was still good, showing the progress she has made. She should try and keep this progress up - ensuring that she participates more in class, and that she will be successful with her final summative assignment. Overall, she should be pleased with her progress and continue to work hard."
Amber,"Cassie is an able student who simply needs to practice her presentation skills in order to achieve the best result in S2. She needs to show critical awareness by ensuring she does not describe the representation of women in Chinese cinema, but analyses what that representation tells us about changes in Chinese society."
Amber,"Cassie has made important improvements in this subject and I am confident that she will do fairly well overall. However, Cassie must ensure she practices her writing and use of sociological terminology so that her answers reflect what she has learnt in this subject."

His listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below 70% in his writing assessment to date, which is below the writing requirement for his chosen degree. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and completing independent learning materials are likely to guarantee chances of progression."
Green,Tony is a very good student who shows great interest in Arts as subject matter. He keenly participates in the classwork and takes part in group discussions
Green,Tony is doing very well in Film and Media Studies. He is engaged and tries his hardest. He is happy to participate in class discussions and his written work shows evidence of applying what he has learnt in class to the tasks at hand. Tony needs now to concentrate more on his presentation skills as this is the final assessment in this module. He must practise his delivery and ability to draw on technical language gained through his time with me.
Pink,Tengkang's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a limited knowledge of sociology which lacks in depth. I advise to get more involved in class discussions and to allocate more time for independent study.
Amber,
Amber,

Pink,"Tony should resit summative 1 as this his grade has been below what I would expect him to achieve, or what he is capable of."
Amber,"Tony demonstrates good English language skills and contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. He listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. He is also fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. He has also handed all of his homework in on time and to a high standard. His writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops and doing extra homework from the Language Development section of the book is likely to improve his chances of progression."
Amber,"Tengkang seems to be lacking confidence in Arts at the moment. He has become very quiet in class and is reluctant to participate. He should try and take a more vocal role in class, rather than letting other people speak for him. He will feel more confident if he prepares fully. His formative assignment result was somewhat disappointment, meaning that he should attend his tutorial ready to discuss next steps, so that he can be successful in his next assignment at the end of term."
Green,A strong student with good potential. Tony is able to grasp ideas and is mostly successful in articulating his understanding. More practice presenting will help him with his S2 and a stronger focus on Film and Media language would also help.
Amber,"Tony has made important improvements and looks to do fairly well in this subject. However, Tony must ensure he practices his writing and sociological terminology so that his answers reflect his learning in this subject."

Pink,Estella is a good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. She takes part in group discussions but seems somewhat reserved and shy
Pink,"Ao is making some progress in her politics classes. She still struggles with her English and therefore does not participate as fully as I would like. Sitting beside Jiang and speaking in Chinese to her, is surely not beneficial,"
Pink,Estella's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a very basic knowledge of sociology which is largely descriptive and lacks in depth. I recommend to get more involved in the class discussions and to allocate time for independent study.

Green,
Amber,I am pleased with the attitude of and progress being made in the AES course by Estella. She is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She has also handed all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Estella has achieved above the English language requirement for her chosen degree except writing. She is advised to attend writing worshops regularly. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude.
Amber,"Estella has shown that she is improving in Arts. The most obvious evidence for this is her summative resit, which showed significant improvement on her first attempt - well done. Unfortunately, her formative assignment was not as successful - but hopefully this was due to her focus on resits. Looking forward to the summative, hopefully she can use the skills she is acquiring to be successful for that task. She remains very quiet in class - it would be good to hear more from her as a way of consolidating her learning. Moreover, she should listen attentively in her upcoming tutorial. Overall, she should be pleased with her recent progress."
Pink,"Ao Li is still very quite in seminars and rarely contributes. Her attendance has not been consistent. For her recent summative assignment, she received a mark of 52% as the essay was confused, although she showed some knowledge of the main points as to  why wars dominated the first half of the twentieth century.


She probably only partially understood the task but still the answer lacked some thoroughness and included passages which were irrelevant. 

Her written English was reasonably fluent in places but she will still need to work hard at improving this aspect."
Amber,"Estelle has some potential but a lack of confidence is what has let her down. She was caught cheating in her formative assessment, which she failed as a result. Overall, Estelle has shown some promise in class, but must ensure that the pressure of the exam doesn't get to her again."

Pink,"Qiya has potential to pass this course, but currently Qiya has not shown enough evidence of absorbing the learning in class and a recent presentation (which is what the format of the final assessment is) also proved to be most challenging for her. Based on this, I feel Qiya is at a Pink level currently and must  be more proactive in demonstrating her understanding and knowledge in class."
Pink,"Level of English needs considerable improvement in order to progress. Attendance of lectures is also patchy. Also, at time of writing this, the student has not confirmed her attendance for an extra session offered to all students during RW."
Pink,"Katherine demonstrates a good learning attitude. Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as she has scored below 40% in her listening assessment, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. She failed to attend the writing exam this term. Attending listening and writing workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are all likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Amber,Catherine is a very good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. She is also very keen in helping others in their classwork and has markedly improve since the beginning of the course
Pink,"I am concerned about Qiya. Her level of English is holding her back, but also her timidity which prevents her from pushing herself more. Qiya needs to work a lot harder to ensure she passes and progresses from her IFY programme. An important part of this is being more punctual and improving her attendance. Secondly, she needs to try and incorporate the film and media language that she is being taught in class more thoroughly into her work."
Pink,Katherine's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a very limited knowledge of sociology. I recommend to get more involved in the class discussions and to allocate more time for independent study.
Pink,"Katherine picks up new ideas quickly and works hard in class. Her seminar skills and written work are now improved. Nevertheless, given the high entry requirements from her pathway, she needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on Moodle are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,
Pink,"Qiya is showing small improvements but still her level of English is holding her back. This is going to be a crucial factor in how well she does in her S2, which is an oral presentation. Qiya also needs to consider resitting her S1 which needs to be a little stronger too help her overall results."

Not only has her punctuality has improved, but so too has her work. Her Summative Resit showed the results of this and was a considerable improvement on her previous work. Her formative assignment was not as strong, but nonetheless her work has improved. The next step would be for her to start to participate more in class. Please keep this up!"
Amber,"Qiya has made important improvements, but sadly this is not enough to give me confidence that Qiya will able to pass-progress on this module. I am confident that she will pass the module and possibly even achieve a respectable pass. Qiya needs to practice long and hard on her presentation skills to enable her to achieve the best possible result for her S2."

Her formative AES assessment results indicate she has a firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and is more than capable of putting them into practice. Provided she continues working hard next term, I expect Naimal's summative results to be of equally high standard. During the Winter Break, Naimal should start working on the AES research project so that she can get started on CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Amber,"Naimal is a good student. She concentrates in class, takes notes and is very involved in class discussions. She did well in her formative and I expect this result to improve based on the feedback. She has good language skills and makes the most of this in class."
Green,"Naimal is a pleasure to teach. She is attentive and always tries to answer questions in class. I am very pleased with the attitude she has towards her studies. She can be playful at times and brings a great deal of positivity to the class. She is focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She has achieved 72% in her first formal formative assessment, which is a very good result for her for this term. I am sure she will continue to make good progress. Well done!"
Green,"Naimal is a good student and valued member of the seminar group. She is a well informed and knowledgeable young woman who obviously has great potential.

Naimal needs to ensure that she concentrates all the time and is not distracted by her phone!

For her formative essay Naimal chose to discuss whether or not globalisation poses a threat to sovereignty. Her work  was well written, interesting and factually relevant.

She researched the subject well and the references she used were both relevant and positive. It is important that all students refer to the suggested or recommended texts and use this as the basis for all essays. This coupled with mature use of the library resources is the key to producing quality work.

Naimal's writing is fluent, well structured and accurate. If she adds a little more checks to her work and checks it thoroughly, she will achieve high marks in future."
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,"Naimal did not submit a first summative essay. Additionally she did not attend the visit to the House of Parliament. I am concerned that, although she is quite capable, there may be other issues affecting her work and studies in this country."
Amber,"Naimal is a very intelligent and capable student. This term, however, she has missed a significant number of AES classes which seems to have taken a toll on her performance in summative assessments.  Most of her term 2 marks came in lower than they did in term 1, with summative coursework 1 being hit particularly hard due to late submission resulting in a fail mark. It is strongly advised that Naimal re-submits this work in Term 3. She also needs to take greater responsibility for her studies and ensure she meets all her deadlines and attends all classes. Should she miss any lessons for unavoidable health-related reasons, it is imperative she gets in touch with her tutor and catches up on all work she has missed. Should she need any help, Naimal should ensure she speaks to her tutor and/or attends AES Drop-In clinics. During the Spring Break Naimal should work on her CW3 and use her AES book and Moodle page to revise all material taught in Term 2 paying particular attention to argument"
Amber,Naimal is a good student when she concentrates. She does participate in class discussions and is able to offer answers when she is asked direct questions. At times her concentration drifts and she will need to work on this if she is going to finish the course. There have also been some attendance concerns recently.
Green,"Naimal -  you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."

A particular area to pay attention to is her academic writing and reading, which are already good, but she should continue to practice to ensure she achieves the best grades possible. Reading more widely will help her to build a greater range of vocabulary. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and choose 2 essays titles."
Amber,"Well done on your hard work this term. It is clear that you try hard for Arts and you have made progress. While you work well in groups, this does not always translate into participating in lectures or seminars. It would be good to hear more from you in both of these environments as you are perfectly capable of contributing to these discussions and this would help your confidence and development. Generally speaking, you prepare well for my lessons, though latterly you have not always read the texts - please ensure that this doesn't become a trend. Overall, you have much to be pleased about - and if you carry on working hard, plenty to build on in order to improve next term."
Amber,"You have been trying hard in music this term so well done. This has shown in your increasing ability to participate in class and consolidated by a strong mark in your formative assignment. You show that you work hard and that is good to see as you are clearly dedicated to your studies. Although you do make an effort to participate, you could take this to the next level, which would also help the quality of your written work. All in all, your work in music this term has been promising: you should be pleased."
Amber,"Your formative assignment was okay but you will need to improve on the summative to attain a progression mark. 
You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. Talk more in class and try to participate more in our discussions. 
With a bit more commitment you can definitely achieve a progression mark."
Amber,

Amber,Hei Tsz is a very capable student and contributes well to class activities. Her summative listening and speaking grades have been very pleasing and they are reflective of her English skills. Hei Tsz already writes well but should continue to work on her R&W skills and as long as she practises and applies the written skills taught in class I am sure she'll go on to do well. R&W practice exercises can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and she could also make use of the AES drop-in clinics for additional writing support.
Green,"You try hard in Arts, and this has led to a very good formative assignment mark. It is good to see you persevere as you are making clear progress. You are still relatively quiet in Arts and it is clear that you do, on occasion, lack confidence. There isn't any reason for this: you are more capable than you realise. It would be good to hear more from you and to hear you taking more of a lead in group work on occasion. The ability to do this comes from close work with the text, which is something you need to focus on going forward."
Green,"You work hard in music, showing that you are a dedicated student. This means that you participate and prepare well for lessons, which is good to see. Your singing teacher reports that you have been working very hard, which is also good to hear - so well done with that. The combination of your conscientiousness in the theoretical part of the course and your dedication to your vocal studies should stand you in good stead for your second summative assignment. All in all, you need to carry on working hard - especially focusing on the way you write about music - and you have the foundation to do well next term."
Pink,Angel will be able to progress given she studies hard prior to the exam. She has been participating in our discussions and has some knowledge of concepts but she will need to push a bit more prior to the exam. She just needs a bit more effort to get a progression mark.

There remains room for improvement in Ahmed’s writing skills however, and it may be beneficial for him to review all of the class and workbook material which gives information and direction about text structure and referencing in academic texts; producing coherent text and using accurate paraphrasing and citation in academic writing, are prerequisites to high grades."
Green,Ahmed has a good understanding and participates well during classes. Should do well and progress to achieve his goal if he continues at this current level.
Green,Ahmed has extensive knowledge of physics and works very well during classes and his first assessment. Please keep this good effort up.
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Ahmed’s understanding of the material is quite good, he is attending regularly, but never submits any homework. In order to achieve 65-70% in tests and exams he needs to keep up with good work in class, but also start to practice at home regularly."

Green,"Ahmed has achieved excellent results in speaking and listening assessments this term.  He has, however, seemed rather tired and disengaged in AES classes, and may have missed some key lesson input in relation to academic writing skills in recent weeks.  In light of this, it would be advisable to review any lesson material for missed classes and to work carefully through the practice exam material in the back of the AES Term 2 workbook – it would be good to see Ahmed reach his potential to achieve high grades across all 4 AES skills (speaking, listening, reading and writing)."
Amber,He needs to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think he is putting in the required effort for the course. He should do self-study every week.
Green,He works well in classes and has a good understanding of the subject. He needs more self-study to progress and achieves his goal.
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative and second formative assessments.
I am a bit disappointed with Ahmed's results. They are not good enough because he is often late, he missed many classes and never did his homework. He has a lot of potential, but he needs to start work really hard in order to improve the situation. i strongly recommend Ahmed to attend all classes as well as the Maths workshop."

I advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. Her listening skills, however, need further development, as she has scored  below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening workshops, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to guarantee chances of progression."
Amber,Lixue has not made any impact in class. She does not participate in class discussions and she is unable to answer a direct question when asked. If this is due to lack of language skills then this needs to be her next area of focus.
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Lixue preliminary test result was very low. She was working well in class and she has shown some improvement of her Maths level over the last few weeks, but further improvement is required. I recommend her to attend the workshop and practice more by solving extra exercises at home."
Amber,"Una - you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to improve your listening writing skills, as well as work on your accounting. I recommend you attend workshop classes after Easter."
Amber,
Pink,Lixue scored 50 in summative 1 so she must now improve her approach. She does not participate in class and does not take notes during classes. It seems likely to me that her main issue is one of understanding the English in class and having the confidence/skill to ask questions. She should focus now on improving her English or run the risk of not progressing.
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Lixue was showing some improvement in her understanding and performance, but unfortunately she did not pass S1 test because of Academic misconduct. I recommend her to attend Maths workshop in order to revise and prepare for her sitting of S1 test at a later date."

She participates in lesson discussions and is fully focused on the content, showing good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Una has achieved well above the English language requirement for IFY programme, which is an excellent result for this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!"
Amber,"Lixue remains a concern as her level of competence in English is not improving fast enough. She has increased her confidence, but this still remains an issue. Lixue must now concentrate on her studies, take notes in class, review the material from term 1 and increase her skill in english if she is to succeed."
Pink,Lixue did not quite achieve a pass grade in the mock statistics S2 test and was absent for the formative 2 exam.  To ensure a pass grade in the last exam there must be a commitment to practising problem solving and ensuring understanding of formulae and the use of tables.
Green,"Una - You are a pleasure to teach, but need to concentrate more in class. You certainly impressed me in the class we held when we were discussing economic theories as you had good prior knowledge. Please be aware though that there is always room for improvement and this is what you should be concentrating on – stretching you knowledge and understanding. Your formative 2 score is 73% and this is a very good result. If you can achieve something similar, or even higher, in your summative 2, you will do very well indeed and be able to progress to RH without much difficulty"

Amber,"Janice demonstrates good speaking skills but seldom contributed to class discussions. I advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as her listening score is below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course and she failed to attend the writing exam this term. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to guarantee chances of progression."
Pink,Yihuan has failed to make any impact on the class. She does not participate in class discussions and does not ask questions. If she is asked a direct question she is unable to answer it. This appears to be as a result of her low level of skill in English. She now needs to focus on her language skill in order to give herself a chance of passing.
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class.
Yihuan missed many classes including the first formative test. Her preliminary result was good, so I hope she will start to attend regularly and will catch up with all missed topics. Please ask questions in class and attend the Maths workshop."
Green,Janice - you demonstrate good knowledge and understanding of the subject and during class you answer some questions. I am pleased to see your confidence growing. You have the potential to progress.
Pink,"Janice has shown her potential in the recent summative assessments, but her results would have been higher if she improved her poor classroom performance. Most of the time she made few contributions in class activities. She needs to participate well in class, especially in class discussion and group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on Moodle are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,
Pink,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative test.
Yihuan got the result just above 40%. She has good understanding of material, but she missed a lot at the beginning of the year. Now she is working hard in class and attends the Maths workshop regularly, so I am confident that she will have better results for the resit of S1 test."
Green,
Pink,"Janice tends to be focused on the content in class and shows a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. However, her overall grades are below the overall English language requirement for her chosen degree. She should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. Attending writing workshops is still recommended. Attending listening workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve her chances of progression."
Pink,"Yihuan continues to lack commitment to learning in class and does not get involved with class discussions. She did show some energy when doing formative 2, but there was insufficient preparation. Her summative 1 was good, but I am concerned about how she will perform when required to give a presentation as part of summative 2."
Pink,Yihuan had a poor result in the recent statistics mock S2 exam although achieving a good result in the formative 2 exam.  She must ensure she practises solving sufficient problems to understand the concepts and remember how to use formulae and asks for help when she comes across a difficulty.
Green,"Janice - Your attitude is improved  in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 84%, please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score in writing. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills and practice revision questions, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result. You need to work hard to progress to RH."

I advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as her overall grade is slightly below the language requirement for her chosen degree. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to guarantee chances of progression."
Pink,Yiqing has made almost no impact in class. She does not participate in class discussions and is unable to answer direct questions. It seems that her english skills need to be improved and she should throw herself into her studies so that she has a chance of passing.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Yiqing is a good student, attentive and engaged in classes. Attendance and  formative test results are good as well. No worries whatsoever."
Pink,"Sybil - You are very quiet in the class, but when a question is asked of you directly, you demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the subject. You need to  improve on your confidence. Additionally, your writing needs to improve too. I see you have the potential to progress, and I recommend you attend the workshop next term."

She is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She has also handed all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Sybil has achieved above the English language requirement for her chosen degree and it is a good result for this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!
Pink,"Yiqing continues to have little impact in class and it appears that her level of skill in english is the cause. However, she had a good result in the first summative and this bodes well for the rest of the course. Her formative 2 work was below standard, but there was some signs of improvement."
Green,Yiqing demonstrated a basic understanding of statistical concepts in the recent statistics S2 mock test and achieved a pass grade.  She has been working hard practising problem solving and this will be reflected in her final exam results.
Green,"Sybil -  Your attitude is good in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 78% good score , please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result"

Pink,Jiahe has made little impact in class. She is generally unable to participate in class discussions and is unable to answer direct questions when asked. This appears to be as a result of her low level of skill in english. She now needs to address this by developing her language skills.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Jiahe's maths level is very good as she is very confident in solving most of the questions that I gave in the lectures. Her attendance and formative test result is great. Well done! Keep up the good work!"

Amber,Jiahe is very quiet in lessons and does not contribute to class discussions. However she appears to concentrate and did well in summative 1. She still has a very limited ability in English and this may hold her back in the long run. She must maintain her level of commitment if she is to pass the course successfully.
Green,Jiahe did not achieve a pass grade in the recent statistics S2 mock test and must work hard to improve on this result.  The language of statistics can be confusing but practising problem solving will support her understanding.

During winter break he should work on completing all AES reading practice exams  and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise him to attend listening workshops to support his English studies to ensure successful progression."
Amber,"Him Yan is a very good student. He concentrates in class and is able to answer questions when asked. His English is developing very well and this bodes well for the future. His formative result was disappointing, but I am hopeful that this will improve going forward if he takes the feedback on board."
Amber,"Him Yan is a good student. He is attentive in class and focusses well, although he tends not to get involved in class discussions. I would advise Him Yan  to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills, allowing him to develop his own thinking in relation to those of his peers. Him Yan has achieved 53% in his first formal formative assessment, which is not a reflection of his full potential. I feel that Him Yan may benefit from attending a few workshops and should look to do so in the new year."
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. 
Overall you are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression."

Amber,When in class Him Yan continues to contribute well and takes an active role in class activities. His summative listening and speaking grades were reasonable but did not reflect his English language ability. He needs to apply himself better to tasks and take on board the feedback to help him improve his marks. He should practise listening and complete some reading and writing skills exercises by using the exam practice booklets included in the appendices section of the AES workbook and attend classes so that he can practise these skills.
Amber,"Him Yan is a committed student. He is not as involved as he could be, but when asked he will attempt to answer questions and focusses on the class most of the time. I still think that he has some challenges with his English language skills and although his English has definitely improved it still has some way to go."
Pink,"Him Yan - you need to pay more attention and keep up with the work; I do not think you are putting in the required effort for the course. You should engage in self-study every week and need to be more interactive in class. You need to improve your listening writing skills, as well as work on your accounting. I recommend you attend workshop classes after Easter."
Green,"Despite a bad mark in Formative 2, Anson will be able to get a progression mark. He is a dedicated student and he will do just fine."
Amber,Comments remain the same as for RPAG4.

Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as she has scored below 20% in her listening assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Amber,"Asli does lack some confidence in class, but she is able to understand tricky concepts and apply them very well. At times she does not seem to be focussing on her studies, but I am hopeful that she will succeed on the course."
Amber,"Asli -  you are very pleasant to teach and demonstrate a growing knowledge of the subject. During class you answer some questions and I am pleased to see your confidence is growing. You do need to improve your listening skills however, and pay a little more attention to you writing, which needs some improvement. I am happy to say though that you certainly have the potential to progress."
Amber,"Asli lacks confidence but has more ability than she is prepared to display. As she becomes more confident in her command of English, I think she will be fine."
Pink,"Asli has shown her potential in the recent summative assessments, but her results would have been higher if she improved her poor classroom performance. Most of the time she made few contributions in class activities. She needs to participate well in class, especially in class discussion and group work. She also needs to complete all her homework"
Green,
Green,
Pink,"I am concerned about Asli's levels of engagement with the course. She struggles with her understanding of English and seems to be gradually switching off more and more.

Her attendance has not been 100% and this is exacerbating challenging situations for her."
Pink,"Asli demonstrates little progress being made in the AES course. When present, she tends to be quiet in lesson discussions, sometimes not fully focused on the content and shows a limited understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. She is advised to hand all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Attending writing and listening workshops is still recommended. Participating more, completing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve her chances of progression."
Amber,"Asli is a good student in general. She does not engage with class discussions, but her written work is good. She has now missed quite a few classes and I am concerned about her motivation to succeed on the course. If she concentrates on her studies she has a very good chance of success, but she now needs to ensure that she attends and commits to the course."
Pink,"Asli - Your attitude is good in class but you need to attend my classes more regularly and consistently. Your absences will make it harder for you to successfully pass this subject, and you cannot rely entirely on using resources of Moodle alone to always catch up. You also missed your formative 2 assessment, and this will only make the challenge of progressing to your chosen degree harder. I recommend you attend all workshops and do not miss anymore classes."
Pink,"Asli has been experiencing some health issues and her attendance has suffered. She is still quite in the seminars and rarely contributes to debate. I am not convinced that Asli understands as much of a conversation as is necessary to progress.

In her summative essay Asli received a mark of 60%. She chose to discuss why war dominated the first half of the twentieth century. She researched well and developed knowledge and understanding of the subject. Her English was only partially successful as it was muddled in places."

Green,Celia is a very good student who shows great interest in Arts as subject matter. She keenly takes part in group discussions and communicates excellently with her classmates.
Green,"Estelle is doing very well in Film and Media Studies. She is engaged and tries her hardest. She is happy to participate in class discussions but needs prompting from time to time. Her written work needs a little improvement, but shows evidence of applying what she has learnt in class to the task at hand. Estelle needs now to concentrate more on her presentation skills as this is the final assessment in this module. She must practise her delivery and ability to draw on technical language gained through her time with me."
Pink,Wantong's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a limited knowledge of sociology. I recommend to allocate more time for independent study and to get more involved in the class discussions.
Amber,
Pink,"Celia is clearly a committed student who tries hard in her Arts lessons and engages with her studies. The reason for her grade on this occasion is that her mark for her first summative assignment was disappointing. However, the main problems with this assignment would be easy for her to rectify, meaning that she could soon be back on track again. She should aim to participate more in class discussions as her contributions are often valuable and this would build her confidence."
Green,
Pink,"Wantong tried hard and is someone who is capable of a lot more than she is presently demonstrating. Her grade for summative 1 shows an improvement, but more independent work is needed. I would advise her to resit summative 1."
Pink,"Celia tends to be focused on the content and shows a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term.

Attending listening and writing workshops,  participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Celia clearly tries hard in Arts, but this is not always entirely successful. She should aim to focus on continuing to prepare for lessons and try to ensure that she reads text carefully. She also needs to listen attentively to feedback in her upcoming tutorial. While her summative resit was an improvement on the original, there is still progress to be made - and this is still more the case for her second formative assignment, where she needs to be very careful to ensure success going forward. Overall, she has worked hard, but there is still progress to be made."
Amber,"Celia is an able student. She has not always performed to her full potential, but I am confident that with more practice and a stronger focus on Film and Media language as well as an attention to analysis she will do well overall."
Amber,"Celia has not always performed to her full potential in sociology, but I am confident that with more practice and a stronger focus on the use of sociological language she will do well overall. She should focus on her revision and timed writing as this will prepare her for her final exam."

Amber,Wayne is a good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. He takes part in group discussions and seems very opened in accepting advice from his classmates
Pink,"I am concerned for Wayne and the possibility of his progressing from this course. Wayne has missed some important sessions and needs to try harder to apply what he is learning in class to his work. I would recommend that Wayne practises his written and presentational skills, seeing as the final assessment in this module is a presentation after all. One of the key changes Wayne can try and initiate to show that he is serious and pushing himself to improve, is by utilising the film language he has been taught in class."
Pink,"Wayne's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a very poor knowledge of sociology. I recommend more attention and involvement in the class discussions, as well as to allocate more time for independent study."
Pink,"Qin works hard in class. Nevertheless, given the high entry requirements from RHUL, he needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on Moodle are likely to improve chances of progression. He would also benefit from completing all of the homework."
Pink,"Wayne has the potential to do well in Arts, but unfortunately this did not come to fruition in his latest summative assignment. He should to aim to engage fully in classes so that he can use his knowledge and apply it to help him to achieve to the best of his ability so that he does better next time around. Participating more in class would help him with this, both in small groups and in larger discussion."
Amber,

Amber,"Wayne does not always seem fully engaged with Arts classes, which is unfortunate. His summative resit was a solid mark, but there is still more work to do, especially given that his formative assignment did not pass. He should aim to engage more fully in arts classes, making sure that he prepares thoroughly, takes an active part in lessons, and focuses on the end goal of his summative assignment later in the year. He should also pay close attention in his upcoming tutorials so that he can focus on what he needs to do in order to improve."
Amber,Wayne has made small improvements and should perform well in his S2 so long as he puts in the hard work and practices thoroughly. He needs to rely less on reading his notes in the presentation and more time presenting by speaking directly to the audience.
Pink,"Wayne struggles with the conceptual dimension of Sociology and this is one of his key weaknesses. However, with final push - strong revision - he may just be able to achieve a mark which is respectable and illustrative of considerable progress for him as an individual learner."

I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. His writing skill, however, needs further development, as he has scored below 70% in his writing assessment to date, which is below the writing requirement for his chosen degree. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to guarantee chances of progression. He should also ensure to complete homework after class."
Green,Shaofu is a very good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. He is also very keen in helping others in their classwork and has markedly improve since the beginning of the course
Amber,"Shofu is an able student with much potential. When he is in class, Shofu is attentive and happy to participate in class discussions. However, his written work lets him down a little. He must ensure that he tries his hardest to showcase his creativity and his knowledge based on what he has learnt on the course thus far."
Pink,"Shaofu's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a very limited knowledge of sociology. However, his contributions during the seminar discussions have been valuable and have shown an ability to reflect critically on sociological issues. I recommend to allocate more time for independent study, which will help to gain more knowledge and to improve critical thinking."
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,"Shofu is an able student but is under performing. When he is in class, Shofu is attentive and happy to participate in class discussions but, his written work lets him down as it shows a lack of care and attention to detail. He must ensure that he tries his hardest to showcase his creativity and his knowledge based on what he has learnt on the course thus far. This requires him to dedicate enough preparation time to his assignments and, crucially, to his end of course presentation, which is 60% of his final mark."
Pink,Shaofu's may reach progression but he needs to work very hard. I recommend to resit the summative assessment 1 and to invest more time into independent study.
Amber,"I am not impressed with Shaofu's attitude or the progress he has made in the AES module this term. He tends not to be participating actively in lesson discussions although he shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. I'd advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. He is advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard. Attending writing workshops is still recommended to achieve the language requirement for his chosen degree."
Pink,"Shaofu seems to be having some problems in Arts recently. Although his attendance has gradually started to improve, his marks are not good. His summative resit was very poor and he did not submit a formative assignment at all. This is unfortunate because he is clearly a capable student with the potential to do well later in the course if he puts his mind to it. He needs to start working very hard and focus in his tutorials to make sure that he is on track for his next assignment."
Amber,"Shaofu has always presented himself as a very able student. Unfortunately, his patchy attendance and general lack of commitment to this course has meant that his trajectory has been less than stellar. Nonetheless, I have faith that if Shaofu does well in his S2 he can walk away with a respectable grade in Film and Media Studies."
Amber,"Shaofu's attendance was his manin challenge, but I am pleased to say he has made improvements in this regard. Overall I am confident that he will be able to pass this module and possibly pass-progress but this will be with considerable effort and dedication, with a particular focus on practising his written skills."

Amber,King Yi makes very little impact in class. She does not participate in class discussions and when asked direct questions in seminars she is unable to answer. it appears that her language skills need development and she should focus on this now to enable her to progress.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
King Yi started late, but got a reasonable result in the first formative test (69%). To increase the understanding and results King Yi needs to attend all the classes and also do work between the classes."
Amber,"King - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class.

Amber,Yanqing has made almost no impression on the class. He does not participate in class discussions and he is unable to answer questions when asked. He must now accelerate his language skills if he is able to in order to pass the course.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Yanqing's attendance and work in class was very good. This resulted in increase of a relatively low (48%) result in preliminary test to 72% in the first formative test. Well done! Keep up the good work!"
Amber,"Steven -  you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."
Amber,
Pink,"Yanqing needs to get more involved in class discussions. He needs to actively make notes, ask questions and generally improve his energy level. His English needs attention which will hopefully improve his performance on the course."
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,"Steven shows a fairly good learning attitude and actively contributes to all class discussions. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. His listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as the grades are below the language requirement for his chosen degree. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to maximise his chances of progression. He is also advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard."
Amber,"Yanqing is beginning to make some progress. His engagement is generally good and he is developing his confidence in class. His summative 1 score was not good enough, but I am hopeful if he continues to grow he will have some chance of success on the course."
Amber,Yanqing did not quite achieve a pass grade in the mock statistics test but with extra practise is better placed to pass the final summative assessment.
Amber,"Steven - Your attitude is good in class, You certainly impressed me with your score in formative 2 is 86%, If you can achieve something similar in your summative 2 your overall score will be very good, prepare for your writing skills and work hard as you did for accounting, you will do very well indeed and be able to progress to RH"

Her speaking, listening and writing skills, however, needs further developments as she has scored well below 40% in her overall grade, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for her chosen degree. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive listening exercises, particular in grammar and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending Drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Amber,Mengni is a very positive student who is a pleasure to have in the class. She is fully engaged and motivated. Although her language skills are not high she is prepared to try to get involved with class discussions. Her motivation and enthusiasm will go a long way to making Mengni a very successful student.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Mengni is one of the best students in the class. She is attending regularly and is very active in class. Sometimes I even need to stop her to give other students a chance to reply the question. I like her enthusiasm and attitude to work. I am sure that her results will be perfect."
Amber,"Mengi - You are pleasure to teach very pleasant, you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."
Pink,"Eos works hard and participating well in class. His seminar skills and written work are now improved. Nevertheless, given the high entry requirements from RHUL, she needs to attend listening workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on Moodle are likely to improve chances of progression."
Pink,"Mengni is an excellent student. She is very attentive, gets involved in class discussions and tries very hard to answer questions when asked. She also takes thorough notes. The difficulty for Mengni is that her English is not adequate to do as well as she deserves to on this course. I have spoken with her about this and suggested that she redoubles her efforts to improve her English."
Green,
Amber,
Amber,I am pleased with the attitude of and progress being made in AES course by Eos. She is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She also contributes actively in class. She has also handed all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Yiqing has achieved above the English language requirement for her chosen degree and it is a good result for this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!
Pink,"Mengni continues to be a very good student who participates in class and works very hard. In fact, she is probably the best student in the cohort. However, her english continues to limit her ability to progress. I have spoken with her and I believe that she is doing all that she can to address this. We continue to offer as much support as we can."
Green,Mengni demonstrated a basic understanding of statistical concepts in the recent mock statistics S2 test and achieved a pass grade.  She has been working hard to practise problem solving to improve this grade.
Amber,"Mengni -  Your attitude is good in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 86%, please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills practice questions given for revision, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result, you can progress"

Amber,You have shown good speaking skills and have tried hard to participate in class. You complete homework and try hard to understand. You need to work on improving your other skills particularly your writing. I strongly advise attending the writing workshop next term as well as regularly practising your listening and reading skills outside of class. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book.
Green,"You have made noticeable progress this term - so well done! You also did well in your formative assignment. You come up with good ideas in group work and clearly try hard, which is good to see. However, you are extremely quiet in class and do not contribute much to classroom discussion which is a shame. It would be good to hear your voice as you definitely have things to say. However, you tend instead to let the discussion happen around you. The next step for you is to put some of the skills and knowledge you have into practice in the classroom."
Green,Yuki is a very good student and always seems very positive. She demonstrates curiosity and clear interest in film as subject matter. She responds to tasks readily. She could be further encouraged to speak up more freely.
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. Your assessment was okay but you can most definitely improve given that you commit on it."
Amber,
Green,
Green,
Amber,
Pink,"Yuki is a keen and attentive member of the class. She contributes well and asks when she needs help. Her writing and reading grades need to improve to ensure progression to his next chosen course. To achieve this she should attend writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up her writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary as well as complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. There are many other resources on Moodle she also could use."
Green,"You continue to work hard in Arts and this was reflected in your Summative Assignment mark. You pay attention and work well in class, showing that you have spent time reading the texts. You make contributions to class discussions, though not as frequently as you could. It would be good to hear more from you as you are capable of this, and it would be a natural step for you to start participating more in lectures. Looking ahead to next term, there is plenty for you to build on, with more active participation being the key."
Amber,Yukino is an excellent student who shows great interest in F&M as subject matter. She keenly does her homework and classwork and works well as part of a team
Amber,"Yukino has faced some personal problems of late which have affected her attention, attendance, etc in class. I do believe she has the ability to do well if she shows some determination about it and try to recover ground which she missed."

Green,"Ahmad has become a lively contributor to the AES class this term.  He passed the formative listening exam, and achieved a good result in the formative speaking assessment.  In order to develop his listening skills further, Ahmad could utilise the resources in the 'Listening: Independent Skills Practice'section on Moodle.  It may also be advisable for Ahmad to practise academic reading and writing skills by working through the practice exam papers in the back of the AES Workbook; by trying to complete these in a limited time, Ahmad will also become more familiar with the demands of the AES assessments."
Amber,"Ahmad is a good student and makes a positive contribution in class. He is usually motivated and attentive in class, only rarely losing concentration. He sometimes participates voluntarily in class discussions, but will always answer when directly asked in class. If he continues like this he is likely to do well on the course."
Green,"Ahmed - you are attentive in class but at times you lose focus. I am pleased though that you are happy to answer questions in class. Your listening skills are also good and generally your work in class is of a good quality too. Well done! For your formative assessment, you have obviously taken the time to really do your research and shown strong analytical skills. This skill will be very useful in helping you to progress on to RH."
Amber,"Ahmad's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a basic knowledge of sociology. However, the contributions during the seminar discussions have been very valuable. I recommend to allocate more time for independent study in order to gain more depth of knowledge and conceptual clarity."
Green,
Amber,
Green,
Pink,Ahmad's grade for summative assessment 1 reflects the lack of independent study. I advise to invest more time in it and start from reading the required sections in the textbooks.
Green,"Ahmad did well in the Term 2 summative seminar assessment and has continued to be an asset to the AES group in terms of the interesting and valuable contributions he makes to class discussions.  In the coming weeks, all AES students will be facing examinations and coursework assessments, and in order for Ahmad to maximise his potential to do well, he should commit to carefully reviewing AES material relating to the structure of coherent texts and working through practice examination materials which are available on Moodle and in the AES workbooks."
Amber,"Ahmad is a very able student and he actively participates in class.
His summative 1 result was good and I expect him to continue successfully going forward."
Green,"Ahmed -  Your attitude is good in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 33%, please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills and accounting, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result"
Amber,Ahmad presents well in his spoken English and therefore engages well in class. His written work needs a little more attention. More practice writing his answers will help him secure a grade consonant with his potential.

She is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She has also handed all of her homework in on time and completed all assignments to a high standard. Jenny has achieved above 60% in overall grades, which is above the English language requirement for her chosen degree and it is a good result for her this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!"
Amber,"Jianing is a very good student and a pleasure to have in the class. Although her language skills are, at best, average she is always focussed and will get involved in class discussions and make very positive contributions. If she continues like this, whilst developing her language skills, she should do very well on the course."
Amber,"Jenny - You seem to be attentive in the class but lack focus, when questions are asked you demonstrate some knowledge and understanding of the subject. You needs to  improve on your confidence. Additionally, your writing needs to improve too. I see you have the potential to progress, and I recommend you attend the workshop next term."
Green,Jenny will have no problem is progressing in Psychology. She seems more than able in understanding the topics we have looked at and she often engages in discussion during class as well. Every time I have asked her a question of some sort she was able to asnwer straight away.

Well done!"
Amber,"Jianing is a very positive and energetic student. Her summative 1 result was disappointing, but I am hopeful that if she takes on the feedback she will continue to make good progress. She now needs to make sure that she has a good understanding of the concepts and material taught in term 1 so that she can build on this going forward."
Amber,"Jenny -You are a pleasure to teach, please be aware that there is always room for improvement and this is what you should be concentrating on – stretching you knowledge and understanding. Your formative 2 score is 70% and this is a very good result. If you can achieve something similar, or even higher, in your summative 2, you will do very well indeed and be able to progress to RH without much difficulty"
Pink,"While Jenny seems to be understanding in class and she is able to answer all questions, her assignments (both the first and the resit) were not good. The first one was low while the resit had elements of collusion. While her mark was 65, I am afraid this will be decreased due to the collusion. 

She needs to take more responsibility and be more independent in her writing. I know she is a dedicated student but the only thing I worry about is her inability to write independently."

In order to make further improvements in his writing grades, it might be helpful for Talha to review Term 1 teaching about how to write an effective introduction in an academic essay, and to spend some time practising writing carefully structured essays under timed conditions. Reading and writing materials for independent study are available on Moodle; these may also be useful for further skills development."
Amber,Tahla is a good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. He takes part in group discussions but seems somewhat reserved
Green,Muhammad is an able student who invariably makes positive contribution to the seminars.
Amber,Muhammad's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects an adequate knowledge of sociology which was also shown during seminars. I recommend to allocate more time for independent study to improve depth of knowledge and with it critical thinking.
Green,
Amber,
Green,
Green,
Green,"Talha demonstrates a good understanding of course content presented in AES classes and is clearly an able student.  However, due to notable absences over recent weeks, it may be beneficial to review the AES slides from missed classes and to utilise all additional support material on Moodle so that any gaps in understanding might be filled.  In order to achieve a good result in AES coursework, Talha should focus on writing a coherent essay and on presenting a well-structured presentation which demonstrates the findings of the research he has carried out.  Drop-in sessions are recommended for additional support."
Pink,"Talha seems to be struggling a bit in Arts recently. Although his work in class remains good, he is quiet and not participating. His formative result was also disappointing so he will need to listen carefully in his upcoming tutorial to ensure that he is successful in the summative assignment at the end of term. He should aim to start participating more fully in his classes as he is more capable than he believes and seems to be lacking confidence at the moment."
Green,"Tahla contributes well to class and providing he gives 100%, he has great potential.

For his recent summative assignment he received 66% and the answer was thorough and generally clear.


Tahla can develop his arguments in a mature manner, but there is only limited evidence of background research and reading with an over-emphasis on the internet. His written English is generally successful and largely accurate.

 




Moderation: Agreed with the mark




I agree with the comments made by the first marker. I would also urge the author to revise the concluding paragraph. It suggests that the only benefits that the UK has had from its EU membership are from tourism. This is not accurate and indicates limited knowledge of the EU."
Amber,"A slow starter, Talha has made important improvements. I am confident that he has it in him to do well. However, Talha can also get distracted easily, and I am unhappy that he did not attend the revision/workshop that was held four times to ensure all students were accommodated."

Amber,"Gizem has demonstrated a high level of engagement in AES classes that she has attended this term.  Her formative assessment results indicate, however, that it may be beneficial to review all of the material covered in Term 1 classes in order to fill knowledge gaps which may have compromised her grades.  To practise listening skills, it may be helpful to utilise the Listening: Independent Skills Practice materials on the AES Moodle webpage.  In spite of a clear, communicative speaking style in class, Gizem’s absence from the formative speaking seminar means there are no formal results to reflect her speaking ability."
Amber,"Gizem is a positive student, but sometimes loses concentration in class due to becoming distracted. Her English is satisfactory and she is able to answer questions in class. Unfortunately Gizem did not submit a formative so it is not clear how she will fare in the summative. Gizem needs to focus on understanding the fundamentals of the topic by doing some reading from the textbook and the Moodle."
Amber,"Gizem is a good student. She sometimes listens carefully in class and is generally focused on the work. I do feel however, that she tends to remain quiet in class discussions and so I advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly in class. Putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills, giving her an opportunity to shape her own ideas against and in relation to those of her peers. Gizem has achieved 63% in her first formal formative assessment and this is a good start. I am sure  she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude."
Green,"Gizem is a good student and a valued member of the seminar group. She works well with the other students and invariably makes positive contributions to discussions.Her formative essay was an impressive piece of work of which she can be proud. Gizem chose to answer the question as to whether or not, globalisation was a threat to sovereignty. She researched the subject well and put together an interesting and factual answer augmented by some good, sensible examples and the positive use of quotations.For future essays she will need to plan her work and read through it carefully to eliminate over-long sentences. A good essay has both structure and pace. If Gizem continues to work hard and put time and effort into her essays she will achieve still higher marks."

It could be helpful for Gizem to review lesson materials for classes missed in recent weeks, particularly those which relate to structuring written academic texts, and also to work through the reading and writing practice exam papers in the AES Term 2 Workbook."
Amber,"Gizem is attentive in class, but she still has some issues in terms of her concentration. Wtih continued focus Gizem should complete the course successfully, but she must maintain focus to the end."
Green,"Gizen -  you are a pleasure to teach. You are always ready to answer questions  in class, and it pleases me to see your confidence.

However, in listening, reading and writing skills, there remains considerable scope for improvement.  It may be helpful to use the independent study materials on Moodle and in AES workbooks to practise reading and listening techniques required in the context of higher education.  To improve writing skills, Belal could attend the writing workshops which are available to all AES students.  These provide an opportunity to consolidate specific skills for academic writing, in particular text structuring and referencing."
Green,"Belal is a good student. He concentrates in class, engages in class discussions and is able to answer questions when asked. He has a good command of English and this helps him to be an effective student. His formative was very good and I hope that he is able to maintain this standard in the summative."
Green,"Belal is a hard-working  student. He listens carefully in class and focuses well, although he tends to be quiet in class discussions. I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills by allowing him to form his ideas in relation and discussion with others. Nonetheless, Belal has achieved 75% in his first formal Formative assessment, which is an excellent result. I am therefore sure that he will progress on to his chosen degree. Well done!"

Belal can produce well-structured written text and has clearly assimilated lesson material relating to the importance of text coherence, in argument essays in particular.  It may be helpful in the next few weeks to work on analysing essay titles and planning possible answers, using appropriate text structures to clearly answer implicit questions; and to work through practice material for the reading and writing exam, which is available in the back of the AES Term 2 workbook."
Amber,Belal has done some good work this year and he is a fairly committed student. He needs to focus and commit for the rest of the time available to ensure success.
Amber,"Belal - you are attentive in class and demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the subject. During class you sometimes answer questions, and I feel you need to increase your confidence and need to improve your listening skills too. Your writing skills need to also be improved - if you do this, you have the potential to progress."

Whilst his formative seminar result was very good indeed, there nevertheless remains considerable room for improvement in other assessed skills (listening, reading and writing).  The formative writing assessment grade that Ali achieved was barely a pass.  It would be in Ali’s best interest to attend the writing workshops which are available to all AES students next term.  These provide an opportunity to consolidate specific skills for academic writing, in particular text structuring and referencing."
Amber,"Asad contributes to class discussions and is able to answer questions when asked. He also concentrates in class most of the time. I am not sure if he is taking his studies seriously enough though, as he had a disappointing result in his formative. If he takes the feedback on board this should help him develop into a successful student."
Green,"Asad Ali is a studious and attentive student. He listens carefully in class and focuses well when working independently or in a group. I advise him to build on his confidence and contribute to class discussions more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Asad Ali has achieved 80% in his first formal formative assessment, which is an excellent grade. Well done. Keep up the hard work!"
Amber,"You seem to be understanding the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you.

In order to prepare adequately for future AES assessments, and to fulfil his evident potential, Ali might benefit from more engagement in AES studies generally."
Amber,Whilst Asad has some talent he lacks energy. I have some serious concern that he is not committed to the last stage of the course and risks his university place. The question is one of motivation because he has some reasonable capability.
Green,"Asad Ali - you pay attention in class and try to answer questions when they are asked. I am pleased to see your confidence and note that your listening skills are good. You work well in class, though you need to improve your accounting skills  and pay more attention on this aspect of the course. Equally, your writing skills  need to improve too.

Her reading assessment score, in particular, was commendable.  In order to bring listening and writing skills up to a similar level, it may be beneficial to utilise the practise material (listening) available on the AES Moodle pages, and to review the Term 1 classes on referencing; using accurate paraphrasing and citation in academic writing is a key skill which students need to demonstrate in order to achieve high grades."

She is one of the few students who is doing the homework regularly. I would like her to be a bit more active in class however, and ask questions if something is unclear.

A particular area to pay attention to is her academic writing; she already writes well, but needs to focus on applying the writing skills taught in class to improving her academic style to ensure she achieves the best grade possible. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and choose 2 essays titles."
Amber,"Well done on your term's work in Arts. You have done well this term, showing that you are building an understanding of the skills and concepts that you need to succeed. You are starting to approach texts well. However, you are very quiet in class and do not always contribute, even in small groups. You are more than capable of this however - so it would be good to see you put more effort into that next term. Your formative assignment was good, giving you a good basis on which to build for your next assignment. Next term, your focus should be on contribution to classes and preparation. Overall, you should be pleased."
Green,"You have worked hard this term in music and your formative assignment reflects that, so well done. However, your participation in class is a little more problematic. You do not seem to participate much in group work and though you are a little more vocal in class discussion. Next term, it would be good to see a shift in this and hear more from you - as well as see you take a more active role in lessons. It also sounds as though you need to devote more time to practising your singing between your lessons, so please make that a priority. Overall, you have laid good foundations but there is plenty to build on."
Green,"You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you."

Amber,Chung Man is a capable student who should be on track to reaching progression. Her summative listening and speaking grades have been pleasing and are reflective of her English level. Chung Man has shown a strong reading ability and I have recently seen an improvement in her writing skill. She needs to continue to focus on her writing skills; and more specifically try to integrate more sophisticated language. She should practise and apply the written skills taught in class and I am sure she'll go on to do well. R&W practice exercises can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and he could also make use of the AES drop-in clinics for additional writing support.
Amber,"You have more ability in arts than you realise. Your formative assignment shows that you are capable of writing a very good essay and arguing your case well, which stands you in very good stead for your final summative assignment. You seem to be slowly building in confidence in lessons, but this could happen faster as there is plenty for you to be confident about: you understand the texts and read them intelligently, so please tell us more about what you think! As we head into the third term, continue to read the texts carefully and back that up with secondary literature as that gives you the best foundation for participation in class and your final assessment."
Amber,"Your work in music is solid, but some hard work on your part could definitely take it to the next level. While you appear to have a good understanding of the main concepts and themes, you don't engage with secondary literature or sources to further that understanding. You could also participate more in class, so that you learn more from discussions. That said, if you work on the feedback given on your formative assignment and practise hard, you have the skills needed to do well at the end of the year."
Amber,"Temar has a problem with her attitude. She is constantly on her phone, not paying attention. She seems difficult to gain the attention of and I have struggled quite a bit in doing so throughout this year. I believe she is more than capable of achieving a progression mark but she has to change her attitude."

Amber,"Nur is clearly a very bright and capable student. However, due to the number of classes she had missed in Term 1, she appears to be struggling with putting the principles of academic writing into practice. This is reflected in her formative writing exam results which are barely at the level required for progression to her chosen degree at Royal Holloway. As summative AES coursework is very heavily based on concepts taught in Term 1, it is also essential that Nur dedicates some time during her winter break to AES revision and attends AES Drop-in clinics in January if she feels she needs more assistance with completing her assessed work."
Green,"Well done for your work this term in Arts. You have done very well, showing yourself open to new ideas and making insightful contributions to discussions, especially in seminars. For next term, it would be good to see you contributing more to lectures: this is something of which you are definitely capable and is a natural next step for you. You work well in class and have shown that you generally prepare well - please don't lose the habit of reading the texts in preparation for class! Your formative assignment was very good - we will discuss ways in which you could improve it at your tutorial. Overall, well done!"
Green,"Nur is a good student who works hard and makes a positive contribution to the seminar group. She is well informed and works well with the other students.

For her first formative essay Nur chose to discuss why and when liberalism replaced realism as the dominant political theory. Her background research and planning for the work was good and showed a clear understanding of the necessary concepts for this study, although she relied too heavily on the internet.

It is important that all students refer to the suggested or recommended texts and use this as the basis for all essays. Working in the library is essential. It is not possible to write good quality essays without doing so!

If Nur addresses these points for future work, I am sure she can attain higher marks and produce quality work."
Amber,"Nur has so much potential and it would be a pity that all is wasted because she could not commit herself. I do understand she has been unwell quite often during the first term but she needs to show improvement during the secohnd term. 
Once more, I believe she has enormous potential and it would be a shame if she cannot live up to it due to poor attendance and no commitment."
Green,

Green,
Amber,"Nur is a very intelligent and capable student. This term, however, she has missed a significant number of AES classes which seems to have taken a toll on her performance in summative coursework 1, which was submitted late and showed work well below Nur’s capabilities. Nur is a very good writer but, perhaps due to the number of classes she has missed, she tends to struggle with ensuring her work meets appropriate academic conventions. In Term 3, Nur needs to take greater responsibility for her studies and ensure she meets all her deadlines and attends all classes. Should she miss any lessons for unavoidable health-related reasons, it is imperative she gets in touch with her tutor and catches up on all work she has missed. During the Spring Break she should work on her CW3 and use her AES book and Moodle page to revise all material taught in Term 2 paying particular attention to argumentation and academic style."
Green,"You are a focussed student and work hard in Arts which is good to see. You work especially hard in seminars; it would be good to hear your voice more in lectures, as you prepare well and have plenty to say, so sharing that would be a natural next step for you. Your formative assignment gives you a very good basis for your summative assignment, so you should aim to build on that feedback to enable you to do well next time. Carry on working hard, with a particular aim to participate in lectures and continue your close reading of texts, as well as building on your assignment feedback in order to do well next term."
Amber,"Nur contributes well in class and is a student with potential. Sometimes however, I feel she is not 100% committed and this showed in her first summative essay which was disappointing. For her re-sit Nur's addressed the question as to what was the global impact of the cold war. She displayed a very good and largely accurate, knowledge of most of the main points related to the cold war and how it affected other countries around the world.

Nur's written English is successful, largely fluent, well-structured and generally accurate. She must work hard to make sure the appropriate tense, is used and fewer capital letters.

Nur's spoken English very good."
Green,"Nur's first year in England has not been good for her for various reasons (medical, attendance, etc). She most definitely will progress nonetheless. I hope she realises that she has capabilities for much more than what she is currently performing. And most of all, I hope she fullfills her potential as she is a very bright lady."

Amber,"Your participation in class has been fairly good, but sometimes you lack concentration. Please try to keep focussed on the tasks. Your exam results were satisfactory but you especially need to improve your writing skills. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle and you can use the grammar book to help as well. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book with the writing questions after them."
Amber,"This term your work in Arts has been solid. We can discuss your formative assignment when you see me in your tutorial, but there are ways in which you can improve on the mark relatively easily so that your summative assignment is better. While you come to classes, there is sometimes a sense that you are not fully concentrating. You would get more out of them if you made an effort to participate - both in group work and in class-based discussion. You should also persevere with reading the texts: the more you do it, the easier it will get. Overall, there are ways forward for you to improve on the foundations you have laid this term."
Green,"Lea demonstrates curiosity and clear interest in film as subject matter. She is active during class, responds well to the tasks and readily helps others better understand what they need to do.
I believe that it would be beneficial if she continued being active and investing in expressing herself clearly."
Green,"You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. 
Your formative assignment was very good. You have great capabilities and I believe we can expect great things from you in the future. One of the things I would like from you is to speak a bit more during class and contribute in our discussions."

To achieve this she should attend writing workshops, use the grammar book to build up her writing skills, read more frequently to build up vocabulary as well as complete all of the practice tests in the AES books. There are many other resources on Moodle she also could use."
Amber,"Your work in Arts has potential. Your first summative was strong so well done. Although the mark for your second formative was a lot weaker, much of that was due to a penalty for exceeding the word count - in future, be careful to read the question! However, the content of your work shows that you are able to read the texts carefully and engage with them. There are some things that you need to build on in order to score more highly in your summative assignment, but you are definitely capable of this, despite your seeming lack of confidence. Next term, it would be good to hear more from you in class and see you build on your assignment feedback as you look towards the final assessment."
Green,"Lea is a good student who shows considerable interest in F&M as subject matter. She works very well as part of a team, and meaningfully contributes to classwork"
Green,Leo has a very critical thinking and good attitude towards studying. She will have no problems with progressing.

An area that could be improved on is her participation in group discussions as greater contributions will help the flow of ideas and improve the interaction between group members. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading practice exams and 2 essays and work on some of the listening activities on MOODLE. Well done and keep up the good work and commitment."
Amber,"You have shown yourself to be a very capable student - as your formative assignment reflects. You have revealed that you are capable of insightful and intelligent interpretation of the texts that we have studied - so well done. However, you are incredibly quiet in class, meaning that it is hard to gauge your progress. As we discussed in your tutorial, you should aim to change this - you can build this up slowly, first by talking more in small groups and seminars and then starting to build up to contributing in lectures. You should focus on your participation and your preparation of the texts for next term. Overall, well done on a good term's work."
Green,"Yin is an excellent student. She demonstrates great understanding and clear interest in film as a subject matter. She responds excellently to tasks, especially in writing. She seems shy though and should be encouraged to express herself verbally."
Green,Your formative showed that you have some ability and understanding of what we are covering. You seem like a committed student and I doubt not that you will progress. The only thing I can say is that you have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. Try talking more in class and take more initative towards the use of English language.

She should continue to work on them to achieve the best grade possible. Yin has already got good reading and writing skills, but it is felt that this term these skills have improved significantly. I believe that as long as she keeps practising and applying the skills she will do very well . There are practice activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook to help support her English studies."
Green,"You are a very strong student in Arts and are much more capable than you realise. However, you lack confidence, particularly in class discussions. As your assignments display, you have a very strong understanding of the main concepts and themes, and you engage fully with the texts. In your second formative assignment you scored very highly and this gives you an excellent basis for your work next term. You should continue to work hard, taking the feedback from your assignment into account, and try and participate a bit more - and you will have the foundation to do very well in your final assignment."
Green,Yin is an excellent student who shows great interest in F&M as subject matter. She keenly does her homework and classwork and works well as part of a team
Green,Yin is very timid and shy but her assessments have shown that she is understanding our discussions. She will have no issues with progressing.

This is reflected in her overall formative exam performance where she has applied the academic skills taught in class. She should continue working on her academic writing skills and during winter break I strongly advise her to complete all AES reading exam practices and 2 essays and in term 2, should it be needed, make use of the AES drop in clinic for further support. Continue to keep up the good work."
Amber,"You have worked hard this term, but do not seem confident in your ability to succeed in this module. It's going much better than you think so well done! Although your assignment mark was not what you hoped, you have a good understanding of many of the concepts that we have covered, so you just need to find the confidence to believe in yourself. One of the ways you could do that is to believe in yourself a bit more - better participation in group discussion (in English) would be a first step, followed by more contributions to seminar and lecture discussions. We have already discussed how you could improve your assignment mark substantially - so there is a lot for you to build on next term to build your confidence."

There is a solid foundation to build on from your formative assignment, despite its problems, so as long as you engage with the feedback carefully, you have the tools you need to do well. Next term, carry on working hard and reading the texts, as well as engaging in lessons as this will deepen your understanding of the topics and texts covered."

Her formative AES assessment results indicate she has a firm grasp on the concepts we’ve covered in class and is more than capable of putting them into practice. What she seems to be struggling with, however, is time management, especially at busy assessment times. This seems to have increased her anxiety levels and negatively affected her ability to enjoy classes this term. It is therefore important that Begum is a bit more proactive in planning her study times and ensures she reaches out to her tutors to ask for help when she find herself to be struggling."
Green,Ayse has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and her first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Green,You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. Keep doing what you are currently doing.  Your knowledge of the subject is excellent and you show dedication for the subject as well.
Green,"You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. Keep doing what you are currently doing.Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this.

Despite being encouraged to attend drop in clinics and/or make an appointment for a tutorial with her AES tutor, Begum has not reached out to get the help she continues to say she needs. I would strongly advise her to make good on her promises to come to the additional workshops and drop-in sessions as they may help alleviate the anxiety she seems to be struggling with in class. Begum should also ensure she fully concentrates in her classes and does not use her mobile phone for non-academic related purposes during her lessons. Provided she heeds this advise and continues working hard in Term 3 I see no reason why she should not meet and exceed her progression requirements."
Green,She is underperforming in class. She must attend workshops more regularly in order to progress. I advise her to work harder in her spare time and to speak with me regularly if she is struggling to understand the work
Green,Begum has faced some issues during this second term but she has managed to come through. I am proud of her efforts.
Green,"While Begum's Formative 2 mark was not as good as I would expect, I believe she will manage to progress. Nevertheless, I just want to raise thepoint that she should not just target a progression mark. She has much more capabilities than this and I just hope she realises this herself."

When he pays attention and when he occasionally contributes in class, he shows himself to be someone who is able to grasp key concepts and ideas in Economics. Gary has achieved around 64% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a good result for him for this term.  I am sure with continuing commitment he will make 
good progress."
Amber,"You have a problem with your attention in class as, often when I ask you questions, you seem to not be following me. I often have to repeat a subject and question twice to you. If you do not understand something, please ask me during class.

You have to improve your speaking skills and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. 

Your formative showed that you have some ability and understanding of what we are covering but you have to improve.

He needs to take on board the feedback to help him improve his marks particularly his writing. He should complete some reading and writing skills exercises by using the exam practice booklets in the appendices section of the AES workbook and attend classes so that he can practise these skills."

This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress. I should mention thought that you have done well in the accounting formative 2. Well done for this."

With the exception of the listening test, which Brian missed, the grades achieved indicate that Brian has a relatively good grasp of the requisite skills for using English in UK higher education.  Considerable further improvement in writing skills may be gained if Brian were to attend the writing workshops which are available to all AES students next term.  These provide an opportunity to consolidate specific skills for academic writing, in particular text structuring and referencing."

Green,Pak Yin achieved an excellent formative assessment mark. He has good skills to write a good lab report. Should reach progression if he continues working at his current level.
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Brian pays attention to the lectures and is very keen to learn. He is doing the homework as well. He has shown some improvement of his Maths level since the beginning of the year, but further improvement is required. I recommend him to practice more by solving extra exercises at home."

Green,"Pak Yin achieved an excellent result in the summative listening exam earlier in Term 2 and did well in the summative seminar assessment, which will contribute to his final overall AES grade.  It could be helpful for Pak Yin to review lesson material for any classes missed in recent weeks and also to work through the reading and writing practice exam papers in the AES Term 2 Workbook - there remains considerable room for improvement in his English reading and writing skills."
Green,He has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Green,He works well in classes and has a good understanding of the subject. He needs more self-study to progress and achieves his goal.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first summative and second formative assessments.
Brian pays attention in class and works really hard. His results reflect that: he got 94% during the resit of the first summative test and 83% in his second formative test. As we still have a few new and difficult topics to study, I would recommend him to do his homework regularly."

Green,"I have no doubt that Sin I will meet progression as long as she remains focused and prepares well for her exams. When in class she is engaged and contributes well to discussions. Her formative exams results have been very pleasing, but a particular area to pay attention to is her reading as the result is not reflective of her ability. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices to help support her English studies."
Green,"You have worked hard in Arts this term and it has paid off with a very good mark in your assignment. You make good and insightful contributions to class discussion, and show an ability to interpret texts both intelligently and creatively. The main jeopardy to progress for you is your attendance, but this has improved recently. If you continue working hard and with better attendance, you should do well. The next step for you is to start being more vocal in lectures as you are naturally confident when contributing so it would be good to see that translating into lecture-based discussion. Overall, well done."
Amber,Ruby is a very good student; she always seems positive and contributes significantly to the discussions in class. It would be beneficial if she further invested in expressing herself more clearly and working with greater focus.
Green,"I am confident you will be progressing but you will need to show more commitment in your studies in the future. Your formative was fair but I am sure you can do much better. You have to improve on your commitment and I would like you to take more initiative towards this. 
Do not miss classes as when you do so you remain behind."

Green,"Sin I is a very capable student who is on track to reaching progression. Her summative listening and speaking grades have been very pleasing and are reflective of her English language ability. Sin I has strong reading and writing skills, but she needs to focus on her writing skills; more specifically, the integration of sources. With a little more practise and application of the written skills taught in class as I am sure she'll go on to do well. R&W practice exercises can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and she could also make use of the AES drop-in clinics for additional writing support."
Green,"You are a strong student, who understands what the course demands of you. You are capable of engaging with the texts and secondary literature, which means that you are able do well. Your second formative result was strong, showing that you have a good basis for your second summative. Where you need to concentrate your efforts is maintaining your concentration. While you are always happy to participate in class, you are easily distracted which is rather more problematic. There are times to have fun, and times not too, and at this point in the course you should pay attention to the difference. However, if you continue to engage and build on the feedback from your formative assignment you should be able to do well in your final assessment."
Green,"Ruby is a good student who shows considerable interest in F&M as subject matter. She works very well as part of a team, and meaningfully contributes to classwork"
Green,Ruby will most definitely progress as she is very bright and clever. I believe she has the ability to achieve much more if she actually shows determination towards studying.

Amber,"You have shown good speaking skills and have tried hard to participate in class. You complete homework and try hard to understand. You need to work on improving your other skills so that you reach the grades you need to progress. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle (for example, doing the listening videos with questions). You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book and the writing questions which follow them."
Green,"Overall, your work seems strong - although until I have read your formative work it is hard to tell. However, your attitude to my lessons is far more problematic. Your behaviour seems designed to be disruptive to your learning (and when working in groups - others' learning) and you could get far more out of the classes if you focussed more on studying and less on other concerns. If you took the opportunity to focus on participating in class, and preparing in more depth, you would have plenty to show for it as you are clearly an able student."
Green,Cihan's essay has shown a good knowledge of politics and a lot of progress since the beginning of the year. The sessions will benefit a lot from his contributions and comments. I am confident that his marks will reflect his good knowledge of politics and his ability to engage with it critically.
Green,"Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this.
You have the capabilities for much higher marks. A bit more concentration and commitment can do wonders with you."
Amber,
Green,
Green,
Green,
Amber,"Cihan always participates in class and is keen to share his thoughts. His results are satisfactory but he needs to work to ensure he achieves the grades required for progression. His weakest area is listening. To improve this he should complete all of the listening tests in the AES books, as well as regularly practise listening and taking notes to recordings like podcasts. His reading and writing could also benefit from improvement. He could attend the writing workshops, complete more of the grammar book and read more extensively."
Green,"Your work in Arts is generally strong. However, you have not submitted your second formative assignment (as was the case with your first formative). This means that you do not have the feedback on the assignment to work with when it comes to your second summative, which is a shame. It would also be good to hear you take a more active part in class discussion, as at the moment you are very reticent and are sometimes very easily distracted. More engagement in class would be good to see and this would provide a strong basis for your second summative."
Green,Cihan's grade for the Summative Assessment 2 reflects hard work and a very good knowledge of Global Politics.
Green,"While his Formative 2 was really bad, I believe Cihan will be able to progress. He just needs to pull himself together and actually study for his exam. He needs to change a bit his attitude during classes, show more respect towards both me and his co-students, and actually understand that he is here to study, not to show-off."

His formative AES assessment results indicate he has a firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and is more than capable of putting them into practice. Provided he continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity, I have no doubts whatsoever that Vibulan's summative results  will be of equally high standard and he will achieve progression requirements in all aspects of the AES module. During the Winter Break, Vibulan should start working on the AES research project so that he can get started on CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Green,"Vibulan is a good student. He contributes very effectively in class, he gives full attention to the class and only occasionally loses concentration. His formative result was excellent and shows great potential. His english is very good indeed."
Green,Vibulan has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Green,"Vibhulan is an attentive student. He listens in class and focuses well when working independently or as part of a group. I advise him to build his confidence and contribute more regularly in class discussions, as sharing ideas will enhance his critical thinking skills giving him an opportunity to shape his thinking in relation to those of his peers. Vibhulan has achieved 71% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a very good grade. He was keen for personal tutorials and asked several questions related to his assessment all of which shows his positive attitude towards his studies. He needs to sustain this attitude over the next few months to progress on to his chosen degree."

Green,"Vibulan's performance in the AES module continues to be of a very high standard. He has done brilliantly in his summative listening and speaking exams and his formative work completed in class or as part of homework, showed his writing skills to be at a high merit level. What Vibulan seemed to struggle with a bit this term, however, are research skills, which was reflected in a lower than expected score for summative coursework 1. I would thus suggest he spends some time during the Spring break on revising credibility criteria and looking for more academically appropriate sources to support his work in CW2 and CW3. Provided he heeds this advice and continues working with the same level of integrity and diligence, Vibulan will continue doing great in his AES module and not only meet but also exceed his progression requirements."
Green,Vibulan is a very good student. He is committed and motivated and has some talent. As long as he continues to do what he is doing he will have a successful university career.
Green,"He has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes, and his first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up."
Green,"Vibulan -  you are a pleasure to teach. You are always ready to answer questions  in class, and it pleases me to see your confidence. Your listening skills are good and you work very well in class. Well done! You have obviously taken the time to really do your accounting worksheets paying attention to details and it shows clearly in your F2 results. This skill will be very useful in helping you to progress on this course."

Amber,"Fady contributes well and takes an active role in class activities; he is supportive of others and also has a good influence on his classmates. His formative grades generally show that his listening and speaking are his stronger skills, but he needs to dedicate a sufficient amount of time to improving his academic writing style. During winter break I strongly advise him to complete all AES reading exam practices and 2 essays and in term 2 to attend writing workshops to further support his English studies."
Amber,"Fady had a disappointing result for his formative, but I think that this is likely to improve for the summative and going forward as a result of learning about how to approach coursework. Fady does concentrate in class and engages when necessary, but could try to ensure that he does not talk with his friends and lose concentration from time to time. He has fairly strong language skills and this will be an advantage going forward. Fady must now spend more time concentrating in class. He can also do some reading to improve his understanding."
Green,"Fady is a pleasure to teach. He is attentive and hardworking, and I am very pleased with his attitude towards his studies. He is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. He has achieved above 70% in his first formal formative assessment, which is a very good result for this term. I am sure he will continue to make progress with his positive attitude. Well done!"
Green,"You seem to understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. 
You do have the potential; you just need to concentrate and commit yourself a bit more."

He also needs to really focus on his reading and academic writing skills for the practice as these are areas that need more attention.There are practice activities for these skills in the appendices of the AES coursebook."
Amber,"Fady is a positive student, but quite often lacks motivation and commitment. He now needs to focus on his studies to ensure he completes the course successfully."
Green,"Fady - you are attentive in class and try to answer questions when asked. I am pleased to see that you are increasing in your confidence. Your listening skills are good and generally your work in class is also of a good quality. You do need to improve your accounting skills however, so please pay attention to this in class. Also, please practice your writing skill and engage in independent study; if you do this you have the potential to progress."

A particular area to pay attention to is his academic writing, he writes well but needs to focus on writing in a more formal academic style to ensure he achieves the best grade possible. Reading more widely will help him to build a greater range of vocabulary. During winter break he should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and choose 2 essays titles to write."
Amber,"Muhammad is a good student who has a good grasp of the subject. He also has very adequate language skills. I would prefer if he would contribute more to class discussions, but he is able to answer questions confidently when asked. His formative result was disappointing, but if he understands the feedback then his summative should be better."

I advise him to build his confidence and contribute more regularly in class, as putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his own critical thinking skills, allowing him to shape his ideas against and in relation to those of his peers.

Areas to improve on are her listening and writing skills, so greater practice will see improvements in these skills.

She does not have the confidence or language skills to become involved in class discussions, but she does answer questions when asked.

She has done well on her formative and I expect her capability to increase during the year."

Green,"Azni is a studious and attentive student. He listens carefully in class and focuses well when working independently or as part of a group.  He is confident in class and contributes regularly to class and group discussions. He demonstrates his critical thinking skills which is a genuine strength of his. Azni has achieved 88% in his first formal formative assessment, which is an excellent score. Azni is a pleasure to teach. His writing skills are excellent and I am sure he will not only progress but will do so with an outstanding score in my subject."
Green,"Syed is a valued member of the seminar group who can be relied on to makes sensible contributions. he is a well informed young man with plenty of ideas and thoughts.

his formative essay was a good piece of work which should provide encouragement for future assignments. However, he ignored all the books which were given as references and it is important that all students refer to the suggested or recommended texts and use these as the basis for all essays. 

Addition Syed needs to check his work thoroughly to eliminate mistakes, making sure that all sources are properly referenced. Only using the internet as a research tool is inadequate. 

The library is a great resource and it is essential that it is utilised for future work.

If Syed learns from the feedback on his formative essay he can achieve higher marks on his summative essays."

He has done brilliantly in his summative listening exam and coursework 1 and his formative work completed in class or as part of homework, showed his writing skills to be of very good quality. Azni’s speaking exam score, while still very good, was below what one would expect of a student of his calibre and as such I would strongly recommend he considers re-taking it in the Term 3 resits session. During the Spring break, Azni should focus on developing his essay outline into a well structured academic essay to maximise his chance of scoring a high mark for his Coursework 3. Provided he heeds this advice and continues working hard in Term 3, I have every reason to believe Azni will not only meet but also exceed his progression requirements."
Green,Azni is an excellent student. He is very committed to his studies and has talent. He will pass the course and go on to do very well at university.
Green,"Azni - you are a pleasure to teach. You answer questions in class when asked, and it pleases me to see your confidence growing. Your listening skills are good and you work well in class. Lately however, I have noticed your concentration level has been low during the accounting topic. You also missed your formative 2 test. Try a little harder to retrieve your earlier enthusiasm and I am sure you will progress with good grades."

Green,"I am very optimistic that Arisa will meet progression providing she remains focused and prepares well for her exams. Although she is engaged in class, her contributions to class discussion could be more consistent as this will help the flow of ideas and improve the interaction between group members. A particular area to pay attention to is her academic writing, which is already good but she should continue to practice to ensure she achieves the best grade possible. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and choose 2 essays titles."
Amber,"Well done on a good term's work in Arts. You have clearly worked hard and this has paid off. You work well in group work and contribute in class, though it would be good to hear more from you as you do not always speak up as much as you could. In lectures, for example, you are relatively silent and you are more than capable of contributing to such discussions. You should also work on your preparation to ensure that you are always adequately prepared for lessons, because there are times when you you have not read the texts - however, if you managed to do that, you would definitely notice an improvement. We will discuss your formative assignment in your tutorial - and there is plenty to build on. Overall, a pleasing beginning."
Amber,"Arisa demonstrates very good understanding of film and media as subject matter. She works well as part of team and shows genuine investment in upgrading her performance in this course, especially in regard to written work. It would be beneficial if she further invested in being more focused and analytical."
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you. 
Your formative assignment was okay but I believe you can do much better than this if you commit yourself to it."

Amber,"Arisa's summative listening and speaking grades have been pleasing, especially her speaking which shows that she is articulate and is able to communicate some complex and interesting ideas to discussion. As long as she continues to apply the written skills taught in class I am sure she'll go on to do well. She needs to stay focused and work on her academic writing skills and R&W practice exercises which can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and she could also make use of the AES drop-in clinics for additional writing support."
Amber,"You continue to work hard in Arts and participate fully in classes, which stands you in good stead as we look towards Term 3. You work well in groups, showing that you have engaged with the texts, and that you are a motivated student. Your formative assignment shows a good foundation for you to build on; there is doubtless feedback that you can take on board enabling you to score more highly in your second summative assignment. You should continue to work hard and engage with the texts, as well as bringing secondary literature into your work in order to do well."
Green,Arisa is an excellent student who shows great interest in F&M as subject matter. She keenly does her homework and classwork and works well as part of a team
Green,Arisa is more than able to get a progression mark. She is intelligent and has a good level of English language as well. I have no worries over her progression.

She must continue to work diligently and remain focused to improve her chances of meeting progression. A further area to pay attention to is her academic writing and more specifically focus on improving her grammatical accuracy. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE to support her English studies."
Green,"Well done on a good start in the Arts course. You have shown that you are capable of good work and this has paid off with a strong mark in your formative assignment. You make valuable contributions to class discussions - it would be beneficial for you to start contributing to lectures as well. In group work, you also work well, though reminding you to speak English is becoming monotonous. We have discussed ways that you could improve your assignment next time round - and you should also ensure you prepare texts to the best of your ability. Overall, you have laid a strong foundation for your work next term."
Green,"Yuliia is an excellent student. She demonstrates great understanding of film and media as subject matter. She responds excellently to tasks, both verbally and in writing. It would be beneficial if she approached her tasks with even greater depth of analyses."
Green,"You seem to easily understand the material discussed in class and whenever directly asked, you are able to answer the question. I would like you to have a more independent approach to discussions, however, and participate by your own choice rather than only when I ask you.

Amber,Yulia is conscientious student who is working hard to improve her English level.  Her summative listening and speaking grades have shown that there is more room for improvement and with regular practice this will come. Yulia has shown a good reading ability and this term I have seen improvements in her writing skills and she should continue to work on the accuracy of grammatical structures. She should practise and apply the written skills taught in class and I am sure she'll go on to do well. R&W practice exercises can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and she could also make use of the AES drop-in clinics for additional writing support.
Green,"Your work in Arts has really improved this term - so well done. You have shown that you are able to read texts and apply theory intelligently, through your recent classwork and this has been a pleasure to see. Your participation, always strong, has improved. However, you are still reluctant to participate in lectures, allowing other students to speak for you - you should speak up yourself as you are perfectly capable of doing so! Your second formative assignment has shown a real improvement, which is clearly the result of this, so well done. You need to carry on working hard like this in order to do well next term. If you take the feedback on your formative assignment into account, you have a strong basis for doing well in your final assignment."
Green,Yuliia is an excellent student who shows great interest in F&M as subject matter. She keenly does her homework and classwork and works well as part of a team
Green,"Yulia will most definitely progress. I believe she has the capabilities for much more than just progressing though. She just needs to realise this herself. She can reach the level of her friend Polina and even go pass it if she shows a similar level of attention and determination. 
She has capabilities she does not realise herself, I believe."

A particular area to pay attention to is his academic writing; he already writes well, but needs to focus on improving his grammatical accuracy as well as  practise listening activities on MOODLE to ensure he achieves the best grades possible. Reading widely will help him to build a greater range of vocabulary. During winter break he should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and choose 2 essays titles to write."
Amber,"You are a very conscientious student with a good attitude so well done. You have worked hard this term which is good to see. However, some of the concepts and skills in Arts do not seem to come naturally to you - so there is still work to be done. You have knowledge to build on but you do need to work hard. Your formative assignment did have some issues (which we will discuss in the tutorial) but you should be able to improve for next time. You do not participate much in the Arts classes which is a shame, as it would be good to hear more from you. You work well in small groups, so please elevate that to the next level and start talking more in class. Overall, you have plenty to be pleased about and build on for next term."
Green,"You have worked hard this term in music, showing yourself to be a dedicated student. You are conscientious and willing and this has generally led to good levels of attainment. Your formative assignment was strong and if you build on it, then things will improve further. You make an effort to participate in class and work well in small groups, but it would be good to hear a bit more from you - you can, at times, be a bit quiet. This is something you should build on next term. Your instrumental teacher has also noted that you are making good progress. Overall, you should be pleased - well done."
Green,"You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. Very committed and passsinate student. While your attention has gone down a bit in the latter weeks, you will have no difficulties in progressing."

Amber,"Kazo is a capable student who should be on track to reaching progression. His summative listening and speaking grades have been good but there is room for improvement. Kazo has shown a good reading ability, but needs to focus on his writing skills; more specifically on paraphrasing. He should practise and apply the written skills taught in class and I am sure he'll go on to do well. R&W practice exercises can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and he could also make use of the AES drop-in clinics for additional writing support."
Amber,"Your formative assignment mark appears weak, because of the problems with plagiarism. However, underlying it was a solid understanding of the text. This means that overall you stand a good chance of doing well in your summative assignment. If you are confused as to what constitutes plagiarism, then talk to your AES tutors or me, as it is an academic offence. However, your work in class shows that you have a good understanding of the topics. Carry on working hard and reading the texts carefully and make sure that you participate in class and you are capable of doing well in your second summative assignment."
Green,"You are a conscientious and committed student who works hard in music. Where you don't pick something up immediately, you endeavour to make sure you understand. Your hard work has given you a solid foundation when looking ahead to Term 3, which means that as long as you continue to work hard in class you will be able to build on what you have learnt so far. You should also continue to practise hard so that you can do well in the practical component of your final assessment."
Green,I have no worries over the progression of Mr. Kazo. He seems able to follow the subject of discussion and able to answer any questions raised at him.

She must continue to work diligently and remain focused to improve her chances of meeting progression. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and 2 essays and some of the listening activities on MOODLE. In term 2, I strongly advise her to attend listening workshops to support her English studies."
Amber,"Hareem is a very good student. She takes notes, engages in fully in class discussions and is very eager to answer questions. Her formative result was good and this will improve based on the feedback given to her. Hareem needs to continue working at her current level and will succeed on the course."
Green,Hareem has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and her first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Green,"Hareem is a pleasure to teach. She is very attentive and pays close attention to the content being delivered. She listens carefully to others in class and focuses well, when working independently or as part of a group. She enjoys participating in class and putting forwards her own opinions. I advise her to continue to build on this confidence and push to develop further her critical thinking skills. Hareem has achieved 75% in her first formal formative assessment, which is a very good grade. Well done!"

Although her reading and writing skills have been good, it is felt that with a little more effort she can achieve even higher grades in these two skills; more specifically, she needs to work a bit more on paraphrasing and the integration of sources. By practising and applying the written skills taught in class as I am sure she'll go on to do well. R&W practice exercises can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and she could also make use of the AES drop-in clinics for additional writing support."
Amber,Hareem is a good student who is interested in the subject and is able to participate in class discussions. Hareem does good work and if she maintains her focus she will go on to a good university career.
Green,"She has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes, and her first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up."
Amber,"Hareem - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."

Amber,You have shown good speaking skills and have tried hard to participate in class. You complete homework and try hard to understand. You need to work on improving your other skills so that you reach the grades you need to progress. There are many recommendations for how to do this on Moodle for example the listening videos with questions. You should also make sure you complete the reading practice tests at the back of the AES book and the writing questions which follow them.
Amber,"Well done on your hard work this term. I know that you will be disappointed with your formative assignment mark, but this can be solved by ensuring that you read the question for the summative assignment - as it was predominantly a question of your having completed a different task to the one that was set. Your critical skills are good and you approach texts and theory intelligently - and this leads to excellent participation in class, so well done. It would be good to hear from you more in lectures as well as in the seminars. You generally prepare well for class and work well in groups. Overall, you have plenty to be pleased with this term."
Green,"Well done on a very good term's work in music. You have clearly worked hard, preparing thoroughly and conscientiously for classes and using this to participate well in class. You are able to apply your skills well and you have clearly developed as a student this term. Your instrumental teacher tells me that you have also had the same conscientious approach to your instrumental lessons. Next term, please keep this up. You should focus on developing your analytical skills as they are slightly weaker than your historical skills. Overall, you should be very pleased."

Her results are very good, but she needs to improve her writing score to ensure progression to her chosen course. She should practise more by completing more of the writing tests. She could also attend the AES writing workshops."
Green,"Your work in Arts shows clear evidence of how conscientious you have been. You have made steady progress throughout the year, culminating in an excellent formative assignment mark - well done! You are gradually starting to participate not only in classwork but also in lectures and it is good to hear your voice in that context as you have plenty to say and your reading of texts is clearly insightful. You have laid excellent foundations - you need to keep this up as we look towards the summative assignment, ensuring that you continue to read the texts carefully to enable you to interpret them intelligently and back that up with secondary literature."
Green,"You work very hard in music and participate readily and freely in class. This conscientiousness has been backed up by strong marks in your assignments and means that you are well-prepared for your second summative assignment next term. You should continue to work hard, ensuring that you pay attention to the topics discussed in class, as wll as secondary sources and this will give you a strong foundation for the written part of your second summative. You will also need to ensure that you keep in mind the practical element of the task."

You are less vocal in lectures; it would be good to see this change as you are more than ready to speak up in this environment. Your formative assignment was very good, showing that you have applied the knowledge and skills that you have learned this term. Next term, please keep on top of all the texts so that you can continue to make intelligent and insightful interpretations of them. Overall, you have done well this term."

Amber,"Your English level is quite good and you seem to understand and comprehend the subject. Your formative however was not good. 
I hope you have understood what we mean by critical analysis and the examples I have used for this. You are supposed to write academically, using evidence to support your argument.

Her positive attitude to learning and the respect she infallibly shows to her tutors and colleagues alike make her a real pleasure to have in class. Shay’s formative assessment results have generally been very good, though in order to progress to her chosen degree at Royal Holloway she needs to work on her academic writing skills as her current (formative) results do not yet match the progression requirement. In order to do so, Shay should work on perfecting her exam strategies and should consider attending writing workshops in the new term."
Green,"Well done on an excellent term's work in Arts! You make intelligent and insightful contributions to class discussions, both in lectures and seminars, and you work well in groups, making the most of opportunities in class. You also ensure that you prepare well for lessons, leaving you in the position to make the most of what we cover in class, so well done for that. Your formative assignment was very good, and we will have a conversation about how you can improve on it for next time. You speak in an erudite manner about texts, showing not only good background knowledge, but a willingness to experiment with interpretations of them - it would be good to see this translated into your written work. Overall, you should be very pleased."
Green,"Shay is an excellent student. She demonstrates great understanding and prior knowledge of film as well as clear interest in film as a subject matter. She is very active in class, but should be encouraged to work more on her written assessments."
Green,"You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. 
Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this.
You have the capabilities for much higher marks."

Amber,"Shay's class participation this term has been exemplary - she has done her student-led seminar to a very high standard and made interesting and insightful contributions to discussions led by her colleagues. Shay has also done very well in her summative listening and speaking exams achieving scores above distinction level for both. Her research and essay planning skills, however, still require some improvement and so her summative coursework 1 showed work below her potential. I would thus suggest Shay spends some time during her Spring break on looking for more academically appropriate sources to support her work in CW2 and CW3 and revising her essay outline so as to maximise her chances of meeting progression requirements for her chosen degree."
Green,"You are an extremely focussed and dedicated student, who readily participates in class discussions. You prepare well for classes and this has paid dividends in your ability to bring together aspects of different texts and analyse them insightfully. Despite this, there were some problems with your formative assignment, but these are easily rectified. However, you should ensure that you pay attention to these so that you score more highly next time round - as you are most definitely capable of that. If you carry on working as you are, and take careful note of your assignment feedback, this will set you up for success for your summative assignment."
Amber,Shay is a very good student who shows interest in F&M as subject matter. She works well individually but demonstrates limited understanding for the merits of team work
Green,"I believe Shae has what it take to succeed in progressing. She has a very critical thinking, although sometimes she seems to have some difficulties in putting what is in her mind on paper. The difference between her in-class performance and participation and her exam performance, I believe, is attributed to this."

His formative AES assessment results indicate he has a firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and is more than capable of putting them into practice. Provided he continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity, I have no doubts whatsoever that Amaan's summative results be will be of equally high standard and he will achieve progression requirements in all aspects of the AES module.  During the Winter Break, Amaan should start working on his AES research project so that he can get started on CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Amber,Amaan is a very good student. He engages fully in class and contributes very effectively. His English skills are very good and his overall attitude is very positive. Unfortunately Amaan did not submit a formative so it is hard to tell how this will translate into his performance in the assignment. The amber rating is reflective of this.
Green,"Amaan is a pleasure to teach. He is extremely attentive in class and has the right  attitude needed to progress on to his chosen degree. He is fully focused on content and shows excellent understanding of the key concepts and ideas explored throughout this first term. I would encourage Amaan now to focus more on refining his writing skills, ensuring that he is able to express complex ideas in a clear and succinct manner. This will aid him well to achieve his full potential."
Green,"Amaan is a good student who invariably contributes to seminars in a positive manner. He is a lively and well-informed young man with much to offer. On occasions he can be a little on the over-eager side but this is not a negative! For his first formative essay Amaan chose to write about globalisation and whether or not it was a threat to sovereignty. His essay showed a fair knowledge and understanding of the subject but the work would have been improved by more background reading and research.It is important that all students refer to the suggested or recommended texts and use this as the basis for all essays. Additionally, Amaan needs to check his work thoroughly to eliminate mistakes. If he addresses these points in future work he will, I'm sure achieve high marks."
Green,
Green,
Green,
Green,
Green,"Despite missing quite a few of his AES classes this term, Amaan has done very well in his summative AES assessments this term meeting or nearing distinction level across the board. To ensure he continues to score high marks in the remaining assessments, Amaan needs to ensure he attends all AES classes and, when performing tasks, reads the instructions carefully and remembers to check and proofread his work before handing it in. Provided he heeds this advice and continues working hard in Term 3, I have every reason to believe Amaan will not only meet but also exceed his progression requirements. During the Spring break, Amaan should concentrate on completing his CW 3."
Green,"Amaan is a very good student who is nearly always fully committed to classroom learning. He has had a bit of a false start to his assignments, but I expect with some more focus that he will complete the course very well and go on to a successful university career."
Green,"Aman  - you are a pleasure to teach. You are always ready to answer questions  in class, and it pleases me to see your confidence. Your listening skills are good and you work very well in class. Well done! You have obviously taken the time to really do your accounting worksheets paying attention to details and it shows clearly in your F2 results. This skill will be very useful in helping you to progress on this course."

His formative listening and speaking assessment results were commendable, and he passed the formative writing exam.  It may be helpful for Daniyal to review Term 1 teaching about how to write an effective introduction in an academic essay, and to spend some time practising writing essays under timed conditions with a view to raising the grade achieved in writing. Practice exam materials are printed in the back of the AES Workbook."
Green,Daniyal is a confident student with good language skills. He participates in class and his work is of a good standard. If he continues this way I expect him to pass the course very well.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Daniyal is working well in class asking questions about the problems he doesn't understand. His attendance is good. He got a great result (78%) in his first test. I am very confident that he will achieve the required final result if he continues his good work."
Green,"Daniyal - you are a pleasure to teach. You answer questions in class and I can see your confidence and the fact that your listening skills are good. You work well during class too, so a big well done! In your formative you have obviously taken the time to really do your research and it shows. This skill will be very useful in helping you to progress across to RH."

Green,"Daniyal achieved an excellent grade in the summative seminar assessment and is continuing to make good progress in AES.  It would be helpful for Daniyal to focus in coming weeks on writing well-structured texts which express a clear and coherent line of reasoning; this should be beneficial for the outcome of his coursework and AES examinations.  Daniyal should maintain his good attendance in AES and endeavour to concentrate his attention on lesson content.  Information about examination technique and practice examinations will be the focus of coming classes, and additional practice material is available on Moodle."
Green,"Daniyal remains a positive student. There has been some reduction in his motivation, but overall he is a strong student with very good prospects for success on the course."
Amber,"Daniyal has been asking questions to check his methods and works well in paired work.  However, he did not achieve a pass grade in the mock statistics S2 test and must attend regularly and practise many more questions."
Green,"Daniyal - You have an excellent attitude towards your studies, but this term you were a little distracted and seemed to lose concentration easily. I feel this is the main reason you have slipped a little, as reflected in your formative 2 results. 63% for you is low since you have great potential to do very well in this subject. Please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result"

Reading and writing materials for independent study are available on Moodle; these may also be useful for further skills development."
Green,Anna is a very good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. She keenly participates in the classwork and takes part in group discussions
Green,Anna is doing very well in Film and Media Studies. She is engaged and tries her hardest. She is happy to participate in class discussions and her written work shows some evidence of applying what she has learnt in class to the tasks at hand. Anna needs now to concentrate more on managing her presentation skills as this is the final assessment in this module. She must practise her delivery and ability to draw on technical language gained through her time with me.
Amber,"Ana's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a good but broad understanding of sociology, however it lacks in depth. I advise to get more involved in class discussions and to allocate more time for independent study."

Green,"Anna has made an outstanding effort to complete classwork in Term 2, and has made interesting and valuable contributions to class throughout.  Anna achieved an excellent result in the summative speaking seminar and is clearly able to formulate and articulate ideas utilising a broad vocabulary.  In coming weeks, Anna should focus on writing well-structured and coherent texts which link precise ideas in logical progression; this is a skill which will be beneficial both in coursework and examination assessments.  There will be opportunities to develop these skills in class, and additional practice material is available on Moodle."
Green,"Anna is a very good student who is attentive and conscientious. She is diligent and well-prepared for lessons. She shows dedication to classes and this has paid off with the quality of her work, which is generally excellent. She is also keen to participate in class and regularly asks questions, showing that she is thinking about the materials studied. She should aim to ensure that she is focusing on relevant material, however, as occasionally she has a tendency to become distracted. Overall, she should be pleased with this term's work - as is shown by her formative assignment mark."
Green,Anna is a strong student with good potential. She is likely to do well in her S2 presentation. She simply needs to remember to analyse and not describe what she is presenting.
Green,"Anna is a strong student with a good level of English. This will aid her in being able to offer express her thoughts with relative ease. However, Anna must practice writing in a disciplined manner and with greater attention to detail. She must also ensure that she uses sociological language wherever possible."

Faizan achieved a commendable result in the formative speaking assessment, and passed the writing exam.  In coming weeks, it is important that Faizan spends some time developing listening and reading skills, as these appear to be areas which he finds particularly challenging.  Independent learning materials are available on Moodle for students to use to help direct their studies, and practice exam materials are printed in the back of the AES workbook."
Amber,Faizan is a good student who is regularly involved in class discussions. He makes useful contributions and is often committed and attentive in class. His english is of a good standard and this will stand him in good stead going forward.
Green,"Faizan - you are a pleasure to teach. You are always ready to answer questions  in class, and it pleases me to see your confidence. Your listening skills are good and you work very well in class. Well done! You have obviously taken the time to really do your accounting worksheets paying attention to details and it shows clearly in your F1 results. This skill will be very useful in helping you to progress on this course."
Amber,"Mr. Faizan was late joining the ISC and he has been missing quite a few classes too. He was instructed to do some independent work but has not shown little0 sign of doing so yet.

Green,"Faizan achieved an excellent result in the summative speaking seminar assessment in Term 2 and has continued to make progress in AES over recent weeks.  In order to achieve a good result in forthcoming reading and writing examinations, Faizan should work on developing the language skills to clearly answer essay title questions with arguments that are coherent and which express a logical and consistent position.  This will also help in structuring both the coursework presentation and essay which are due to submitted shortly."
Green,Faizan is a positive and confident student. He appears to enjoy the lessons and actively participates in class discussions. His written assignment was good and he should continue to work at this level if he plans to progress.
Green,"Faizan - Your attitude is good in class, you need to concentrate more in the class, your score for formative 2 is 36%, you were a bit confused in certain section of accounting please fix a tutorial section with me will help you, please redouble your efforts and attend the workshops this term to improve your score. My advice would be for you to concentrate particularly on your writing skills, as summative 2 is a written exam worth 60% of your overall Economics result"

Green,"Syed is an extremely polite and conscientious student, but he's politeness translates far too often into lack of participation in class discussion. As university learning is so dependent on widening one's horizons through confronting one's own preconceptions with the ideas of others, it is extremely important that Syed overcomes his shyness and makes more of an effort to take an active part in seminars. 
Syed has done well in his Term 1 formative assessments, but there is still plenty of room for him to improve, particularly in terms of academic writing. He should, therefore, ensure he devotes some time during the Spring break to revise academic writing principles taught in Term 1 and do some independent writing practise. He should also start researching his AES Research project title in preparation for CW1."
Amber,"Syed is a little laid back in class. He does not voluntarily participate in class discussions, but if asked he will offer an answer. He has reasonably good language skills and this will help him going forward. I would like to see him get more involved with class discussion and take the risk of getting a few things wrong."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Syed has good understanding of the materials we are studying, he is working well in class. His test result was quite good. I am confident that if Syed continues his good work and attends regularly, we will see further improvement of his results."
Amber,"Naqvi - you demonstrate some knowledge of the subject and I am pleased to see that you try and answer some questions during class. This is evidence that your confidence is growing, but I think you could develop this further. You do need to improve your listening skills however, as well as improving you written skills. If you do this, I am confident you have the potential to progress."

He has also shown massive improvement in class participation and is now contributing to class discussions much more frequently- this is excellent, as more often than not, Syed's comments are spot on and help others understand the issues discussed to a greater extent. Provided Syed continues working hard this term, I have no doubts whatsoever that he will meet AES progression requirements for his chosen RHUL degree."
Amber,"Syed is a solid student who is able. He does not actively participate in class, but when asked he is able to answer questions and appears to have a good understanding of the topics. His formative 2 was below what I would have expected, but if he takes the feedback on board I am optimistic for his progress."
Green,Syed would have a greater chance of a good final result if his attendance had been better in these final weeks.  He was unable to achieve a pass grade in his mock statistics S2 test but in class demonstrates a much better understanding.  He asks questions when he needs help and if he puts the effort in to practising solving problems in the last couple of weeks he could achieve a pass grade at least.
Green,"Naqvi - You are a pleasure to teach, but need to concentrate more in class. You certainly impressed me in the class we held when we were discussing economic theories as you had good prior knowledge. Please be aware though that there is always room for improvement and this is what you should be concentrating on – stretching you knowledge and understanding. Your formative 2 score is 84% and this is a very good result. If you can achieve something similar, or even higher, in your summative 2, you will do very well indeed and be able to progress to RH without much difficulty."

I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. He is advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard. Attending writing workshops is still recommended as he has scored no more than 50% in the formative writing exam."

Amber,"Ahsan is not consistent in his attendance or his approach to study. He is a capable student, but I feel he is under-performing at present. 

His recent essay showed a fair understanding of the major concepts relevant to the question but was answered simplistically with far too little quality research. He relied too heavily on internet resources and not on independent reading. His mark of 48% was disappointing.

His written English is generally satisfactory and moderately fluent. he must work hard at this are to eliminate the errors."

In order to develop his general listening skills, with a view to achieving an improved outcome in the forthcoming summative listening test, Ahmed could utilise resources in the 'Listening: Independent Skills Practice' section on Moodle.  It may also be useful to review AES materials about how to structure an academic essay effectively, and to work through the practice exam papers in the back of the AES Workbook."

Ahmed’s result in the summative speaking seminar assessment was highly commendable.  In order to achieve a similar level of success in coming assessments and exams, it could be helpful to use the available practice examination materials (in AES workbooks and on the Moodle AES pages) for independent study.  Ahmed should make a concerted effort to review good essay writing technique; this will be beneficial for both the CW3 essay and as a guide to structuring the CW2 presentation."
Amber,Ahmed is a good student who is able to participate in class when asked. His work is of a good standard and summative 1 was particularly good. Going forward he needs to ensure that his level of motivation remains high in order to successfully complete the course.

Amber,"Ahmed has lots of ground to make up as he has disappointed in his summative assignment. A mark of 33% was well below the levels of which he is capable.

His contributions to seminars can be positive but erratic and inconsistent. In his essay, Ahmed appears to write in good English but much of it was obviously copied

Whilst he may have a fair knowledge and understanding of the subject, the work he presented was little more than a list coped from web sites."

For her first formative essay Sihaam chose to write about Liberalism and Realism. Whilst she clearly understood the question and included many good points the essay would have been improved by greater research. For future work, I suggest more background reading and better use of academic resources. With these improvements, I will expect her to achieve much higher grades."
Green,"You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. 
Your formative assignment was good but I am certain you can do much better than this.
You have the capabilities for much higher marks."

Green,"Sihaam’s performance in the AES module continues to be of a very high standard. She has done brilliantly in her summative listening and speaking exams and her formative work completed in class or as part of homework, showed her writing skills to be at a distinction level. What Sihaam seemed to struggle with a bit this term, however, are research skills, which was reflected in a lower than expected score for summative coursework 1. I would thus suggest Sihaam spends some time during her Spring break on revising credibility criteria and looking for more academically appropriate sources to support her work in CW2 and CW3. Provided she heeds this advice and she continues working with the same level of integrity and diligence, Sihaam will continue doing great in her AES module and not only meet but also exceed her progression requirements."
Green,"You continue to try hard in Arts and are an engaged student. You take the time to read the texts and come to class prepared, which is good to see. You also make the effort to participate, both in lectures and seminars, which has helped you develop as a student. Your summative assignment was somewhat disappointing, but it was clear that you understood where you had gone wrong, so those errors will not be replicated in future. You are, however, easily distracted in class: try and make sure that you maintain your focus in group work, rather than letting yourself be distracted by other people's behaviour. Otherwise, you should be pleased with your term's work."
Green,"Sihaam continues to make a positive contribution and is working hard.
I have confidence in her to do well."
Green,I have no concerns over Sihaam's progression but I do believe she can do much better than what she is currently doing if she focuses a bit more on her studies.

She contributes well and takes an active role in class activities showing a good level of criticality. A particular area to pay attention to is her academic writing; she already writes well, but needs to focus on applying the academic writing skills taught in class to improving her academic style. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and complete 2 essays title."
Green,"Sahar is a very good student. She is very motivated, focuses her attention in class and joins in with class discussions. She is always very eager to answer questions and contribute. Her formative result was excellent and I am very optimistic about Sahar's future on the course."
Green,Sahar has extensive knowledge of Maths and works very well during classes and her first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up.
Green,Sahar is a pleasure to teach. Her enthusiasm and lively nature enhance the liveliness of the class and adds much to the learning environment. She is doing very well in Economics and I am sure will progress to her chosen degree. Keep up the good work Sahar!

Green,"Sahar is a capable student who is on track to reaching progression. Her summative listening and speaking grades have been very pleasing and are reflective of her English language ability. Sahar has shown good reading and writing ability, but she needs to focus on her writing skills; more specifically the integration of sources. By practising and applying the written skills taught in class I am sure she'll go on to do well. R&W practice exercises can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and she could also make use of the AES drop-in clinics for additional writing support."
Green,"Sahar did a very good summative 1 and is a very competent student, but she often lacks focus. She does get involved in class discussions and is often able to contribute usefully to these. As long as Sahar can maintain her commitment she will do well going forward."
Green,"She has extensive knowledge of physics and works very well during classes, and her first assessment was very successful. Please keep this good effort up."
Green,"Sahar - you are a pleasure to teach. You are always ready to answer questions  in class, and it pleases me to see your confidence. Your listening skills are good and you work very well in class. Well done! You have obviously taken the time to really do your accounting worksheets paying attention to details and it shows clearly in your F2 results. This skill will be very useful in helping you to progress on this course."

Green,"Cerenne’s positive attitude to learning and the respect she consistently shows towards her tutors and classmates alike make her a real pleasure to teach. Her formative AES assessment results indicate she has a very firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and is more than capable of putting them into practice. Provided she continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity, I have no doubts whatsoever that Cerenne’s summative results will be of an equally high standard and she will achieve progression requirements in all aspects of the AES module. During the Spring Break, Cerenne should start working on her AES research project so that she can get started on her CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Green,Cerenne is an excellent student who shows great interest in Arts as subject matter. She is also very keen in helping others in their classwork
Green,"Cerenne is a good student, dedicated and attentive during class. She is very good in note-taking and often has good comments during our discussions. I have no concerns over her progression. She should be a little more attentive of her attendance however."
Green,Cerenne's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a good knowledge of sociology. Her contributions to class discussions are very welcome and she has shown increasingly more confidence to articulate her position. I recommend to allocate more time to independent study and wider reading of scholarly literature.
Green,
Green,

Green,
Green,"Cerenne continues to excel in the AES module. Her summative speaking, reading and listening results this term are among the highest in the entire cohort and her participation in class remains exemplary. As she needs to score 70% in writing to progress to her chosen degree, Cerenne's focus needs to be on the remaining writing assessments and CW3 in particular. She should ensure she takes the feedback she's received for her essay outline on board and needs to make the best of Term 3 tutorials available to her prior to the submission deadline."
Green,"Cerenne does very good work in class though she occasionally has a tendency to be somewhat distracted. Her results, however, are excellent, showing that she is a bright and able student, so she should ensure she maintains focus in lessons so that she is able to gain the most from the lessons. She participates thoughtfully, although she could focus her attention on her preparation. She should be pleased with this term's work, but ensure she maintains concentration as we head to the final assessment period."
Green,"Cerenne is a very charismatic student who, despite lacking the adequate determination and passion towards the subject, always delivers both in the assignments and in questions during class. I have absolutely no concerns with her progression."
Amber,"Cerenne is an able student with much potential. In the end, her dedication, commitment, and hard work will determine whether she meets her full potential or under performs. I was disappointed that she was the only student out of the entire cohort to not have sat her formative assessment. Nonetheless, I believe Cerenne has it in her to do rather well."

Amber,"Lydia is a hard-working and conscientious student. She listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as a group. She also actively contributes, when present, to all class discussions and when she does it enriches the learning environment. Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as her listening score is below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course and she failed to attend the writing exam this term. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to guarantee chances of progression."
Green,Lydia is a very good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. She keenly participates in the classwork and takes part in group discussions
Green,"Lydia is a bright young woman with plenty to offer. She makes positive contributions to the seminars and debates and will, I feel confident progress well. He formative one essay was good and she achieved a mark of 75%."
Green,"Lydia's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a good knowledge of sociology. I welcome her contributions to the class discussions which show depth of knowledge and an ability to engage critically with various sociological issues. I recommend to allocate more time for independent study, especially for reading scholarly literature."
Amber,

Amber,
Amber,I am pleased with Lydia's attitude and the progress she's made in the AES course. She is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She has also handed all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Yiqing has achieved above the English language requirement for her chosen degree and it is a good result for this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!
Green,"Lydia works hard in Arts and this has led to a promising result in her formative assignment. She is keen to participate and engage with the texts, meaning that her work has continued to improve. She works well both in groups and alone. She maintains focus consistently and shows that she prepares for lessons, though she could continue to do that more. Sometimes, she reveals that she does not read much outside classes and this might be an interest that she might want to develop more as she looks ahead to her university education. Overall, however, a very good term's work."
Green,"Lydia is a sharp and able student who contributes well to the seminars. She has the ability to do very well at her studies.

Her mark of 80% on her summative essay was very encouraging.  She answered the question in a mature  and relevant manner.


Her written English is good and whilst she confused her tenses in places her work is largely fluent and well structured, with few mistakes."
Green,Lydia has shown a good ability in thinking sociologically and proved very successful in her formative assessment. She needs to revise hard and ensure she performs as well in her summative assessment.

Her outstanding result in the formative speaking seminar assessment is reflective of her commendable abilities in spoken communication.  Amjad achieved a pass grade in both the formative listening and writing assessments.  In order to improve assessed skills in coming months, it may be helpful for Amjad to work through some of the reading, writing and listening ‘Independent Skills Practice’ materials on the Moodle AES page, and also to utilise the exam practice material in the back of the AES Workbook."
Green,Amjad is an excellent student who shows great interest in Arts as subject matter. She is also very keen in helping others in their classwork
Green,"Amjad is a good student, dedicated and attentive during class. She is very good in note-taking and often has good comments during our discussions. I have no concerns over her progression."
Green,"Jad's mark for the Formative Assessment 1 reflects a good knowledge of sociology. Her contributions during the seminar discussions have been very valuable.

Green,"Amjad achieved another outstanding result in her summative speaking seminar assessment and continues to be an enthusiastic participant in class activities and discussions.  To ensure that she meets her full potential to do well in all AES assessments, Amjad should focus her AES independent study time on writing well-structured and coherent texts which link precise ideas in logical progression; this is a skill which will be beneficial both in coursework and examination assessments.  It is also important that Amjad hones her proof reading skills in order to self-correct written exam answers and coursework essays."
Green,"Amjad is an excellent student, showing dedication to her studies which has shown in her results. She has very strong results which puts her in a very good place for her summative assignment later in the year. She participates readily and thoughtfully in class, showing that she has prepared thoroughly - and she shows that she thinks about texts carefully. Overall, she should be very pleased with the term's work."
Green,"I believe Amjad has a great future ahead of her. She is a very determined student, from whom we can expect great things in the future."
Green,A strong student with great potential. Amjad needs to concentrate on ensuring her answers are precise and make use of sociological vocabulary. I am confident that she will do well in her final assessment.

In order to consolidate the work covered in AES Term 1, and to improve reading and writing grades in particular, it would be good to review class and Moodle materials which focus on the structure of effective academic essays.  It may also be beneficial to Patricia to revise some of the basic grammar covered in the Oxford EAP textbook (pp6-15)."
Amber,Patricia is a very good student who shows interest in Arts as subject matter. She keenly participates in the classwork and takes part in group discussions
Green,"Patricia is a good student, dedicated and attentive during class. She is very good in note-taking and often has good comments during our discussions. I have no concerns over her progression."

Green,
Green,"Patricia generally demonstrates a good understanding of course content in AES, but due to notable absences over recent weeks she may have missed some important input.  It would be therefore advisable for Patricia to review AES slides from missed classes and to utilise all additional support material on Moodle so that any gaps might be filled.  In order to achieve a good result in AES coursework, Patricia should focus on writing a coherent essay and on presenting a well-structured presentation which demonstrates the findings of the research she has carried out.  Drop-in sessions are recommended for additional support."
Green,"Patricia is a vocal and sometimes enthusiastic student in Arts, who is often articulate and participates well in class. However, this did not translate into particularly high achievement in her recent formative assignment, so she will need to pay particularly close attention in her tutorials to ensure success in her summative assignment at the end of the course. She occasionally has a tendency to become distracted and she should aim to ensure that she maintains focus throughout classes as we look ahead to the final assessment period. Overall, she should be pleased, but there is still work to do."
Green,Patricia is a very good student who delivered in her summative assignment. I would like her to be participatory in class as I believe she has the potential to be so. Try to be in class in time also please (although this has imporved lately).
Amber,"Patricia is an able students but her poor attendance means there are significant gaps in her knowledge. She needs to remedy this fast and work hard by revising her notes, her textbook and the PPT on Moodle to prepare herself for her S2."

In coming weeks, it could be helpful for Merriam to review AES materials related academic writing, and to practise analysing and answering exam style essay questions, with a particular focus on answering questions implicit in the title(s).  It may also be beneficial to practise writing well-planned and structured texts under timed conditions.  Practice exam papers are available in the back of the AES workbook."

It may also be useful to utilise examination practice materials for independent study, available on Moodle and in AES workbooks.   Regarding coursework assessments, Merriam should pay careful attention to the given briefs, in order to meet specified requirements and best demonstrate how she has consolidated her AES learning."
Green,"Merriam is clearly a dedicated and conscientious student. She works hard and prepares for lessons, meaning that she is well-placed to contribute in an insightful and meaningful way. This hard work has paid off meaning that she has done well in her assignments, including her recent formative assignment, and she is very well-placed to do well in her final summative assignment. She works well and maintains focus, showing that she is serious about her studies. Overall, she should be very pleased with her term's work."
Green,"Merriam is a very dedicated student and this is reflected in her marks. I have no concerns regarding her progression at all. I would ask her, however, to try to be in class on time."
Green,Merrium has very good potential and very good chances of completing this module with strong results. She needs to revise hard and practice her writing skills more to ensure she secures a grade in sociology commensurate with her potential.

It may be helpful for Jiayi to engage in more focussed vocabulary extension activities in coming months, to enable her to utilise a greater range of expression and subject specific language.  It may also be beneficial to review some of the language practised in the Oxford Grammar textbook, particularly the first few chapters."

Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative assessment. Fiona’s Maths skills are very good, she already knows material we are studying in class, her test result was very high. She is not working with class but studies some advance materials of her own.

She has also done very well to apply the academic skills to her written work. An area to work on is her listening skills and over the winter break she should practise the listening activities on MOODLE to ensure she achieves the best grade possible. During winter break she should work on completing all AES reading exam practices and choose 2 essays titles.
Green,"You have shown yourself to be a hardworking and dedicated student, making the most of the opportunities you have to develop in class. You prepare texts well (keep on doing this!) and show an ability to interpret them well. Your formative assignment was strong so well done: but as we have discussed there are elements on which you can build next time. The next step for you is undoubtedly to take a more prominent role in lecture discussions: you should try this next term as it will help you develop further as a student. Overall, you have much to be pleased about this term so well done."
Green,You are a very able student and I have no worries over your progression. Keep doing what you are currently doing.  Your knowledge of the subject is excellent and you show dedication for the subject as well.

Green,Polina is a very capable student who is on track to reaching progression. Her summative listening and speaking grades have been very pleasing and are reflective of her English language skills. The skill that she needs to focus on more is her listening which she finds a little tricky. I believe with a little more practice it will definitely see improvements. Polina has shown strong reading and writing skills and she takes on feedback and applies it well. More listening practice tasks can be found in the appendices of the AES coursebook and she can use activities uploaded on MOODLE for further support.
Green,"You are a highly motivated and conscientious student. The results of this have been shown in your second formative result which is very strong - so well done. You are starting to reap the results of the work you have done so far. Building on this feedback will enable you to do very well in your final assessment. Your participation in both seminars and lectures is insightful and intelligent and shows your diligent preparation - and note-taking. Carrying on like this, as well as continuing to explore secondary literature, will ensure that you have the skills to do well next term."

During the course of Term 1 she has shown great charisma that helped motivate other students to participate in class and thus contributed to building a positive learning environment. Madhuri’s formative AES assessment results indicate she has a firm grasp on the concepts we’ve covered in class and is more than capable of putting them into practice. Provided she continues working with the same level of dedication and integrity, I have no doubts whatsoever that her summative results will be equally impressive. During the Winter Break, Madhuri should start working on the AES research project so that she can get started on CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Green,"Well done on an outstanding start to your Arts course. Your assignment showed remarkable insight and ability to consolidate your opinions and arguments with relevant literature. You work well in class, making excellent contributions that are insightful, intelligent and creative and this applies to both lectures and seminars. You also work well in smaller groups which is good to see. Your consistent and conscientious approach to preparation has paid off, so please keep this up. Overall, you should be very pleased with your work this term - ensure you carry on at this level!"
Green,Madhuri has made a steady progress since the beginning of this course. Her contributions to the class are very valuable and show a strong interest in politics. The formative essay reflects her interest and shows good knowledge and analytical skills. I am confident her marks will reflect her knowledge and abilities.
Green,"One of the best students I have tought in my role here at the ISC. I am certain we can expect great things from her. Not only is she intellignet and critical, she is also committed to what she does. I am certain she will achieve in her life."
Green,

Green,"Madhuri's hard work this term seems to have really paid off as all her AES results to date came in at a distinction level or above. She is attentive in class and open to advice on how to improve her work further, which means her skills are constantly developing and her (already very excellent) written work is constantly improving. With such attitude, Madhuri is on a clear road to success and, should she continue working as hard as she did in Term 2, I have no doubt whatsoever that she will meet and exceed all her progression requirements. During her Spring break, Madhuri should concentrate on completing her CW 3."
Green,"You are a very focussed student and you have tried hard this term. This has paid off with excellent marks for both your first summative and second formative assignments. You show an ability to engage not just with primary texts but also secondary criticism, and understanding of how to synthesise that information. You willingly contribute both in seminars and lectures, showing that you are fully engaged with the course. In order to continue do well, carry on working hard - I know Brecht will be new to you - and you have the ability to do very well in your final summative assignment."
Green,"Madhuri has always shown a very good knowledge of politics through her participation in the class discussions. Her grade for the Summative Assessment 2 not only reflects her knowledge and very good research skills, but also hard work and an ability to engage in depth with new topics."
Green,One of the best students in this cohort. Amazing critical insight and thinking. We could expect great things from Madhuri in the future.

In terms of her class participation, however, there is still some room for improvement, as Nathalie gets very easily distracted and often fails to pay attention to the instructions and explanations given. This may potentially negatively affect her ability to complete summative AES coursework in term 2, which – unlike the exams –is knowledge rather than skills based. It is therefore very important that Nathalie dedicates some time during her winter break to go through the concepts taught in Term 1 in order to ensure she completes all her summative assessments to a high standard she is capable of."
Green,"You have generally worked well this term in Arts. Your formative assignment mark was excellent - so well done for that. You also prepare well for lessons - please keep that up and ensure that you read texts fully. In class, however, you could do with concentrating a little more on the matter at hand. Sometimes you get a bit distracted, so watch out for that. It would also be good to hear from you a bit more - you have the capability to participate more. You have plenty to say both in lectures and in seminars, but rarely do so. Next term, this is definitely something to aim for. Overall, you have made a very good start, but there are areas for development."
Green,Nathalie has made excellent progress since the beginning of the course. Her essay shows good knowledge and analytical abilities. She is very conscientious and invests time in independent study. I am confident her marks will reflect her knowledge and interest in politics.
Green,"Your formative assignment was excellent. You also won the quiz we did in class. I believe you are a very intelligent student who can achieve great things in the future. That potential can however go to waste if you do not commit to what you are supposed to be doing in your time here: studying. 
I have already talked to you about it that you are a person who has a lot of potential, given that you show adequate maturity and commitment. 

Your phone does NOT control your life."

Green,Nathalie has had another very successful term in her AES module with all her summative results to date coming in at a distinction level or above. Nathalie should now focus on further developing her research and academic writing skills so as to ensure she achieves a high mark for her CW3 thus maximising her chances of progression to her chosen degree.
Green,"You are a very bright and capable student with the ability to do well in Arts. Your attitude in class has changed for the better, which has been good to see, though it would be nice to see that carry over a bit more into lectures. Your formative assignment gives you a very good basis for your second summative assignment, as the foundations are already in place. Despite your clear understanding of the texts and concepts you are relatively quiet in class. This is a shame as you have a lot to contribute - it would be good to hear more from you. Along with the main points from your assignment feedback, this is the main thing for you to work on next term."
Green,Nathalie has also been very conscientious about the course assignments. Her grades for the Summative Assessment 1 and Formative Assessment 2 reflect a very good knowledge of politics and good research skills.
Green,Nathalie is one of the most talented students in this cohort. Her addiction to her phone is the only thing which might bring her performance down.

Green,"Junyu is hardworking in class and shows a commendable attitude to AES.  He achieved excellent results in the formative listening and speaking assessments this term.  His writing shows promise, but his formative writing result, although a pass, was relatively low.  It might be helpful for Junyu to practise writing answers to examination questions (available in the back of the AES workbook) under timed conditions, and to focus on structuring academic essays with a view to providing clear, concise yet well-supported arguments supporting a particular thesis statement."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first formative test.
Junyu is one of the best students in the class. He is working regularly to a high standard and always tries to understand the problem in detail. I really like his curiosity and desire to learn more. I am sure that we can expect great results from him."
Green,Amos is a talented studnet who has plenty to offer. He is mature and well read and this is evident by his contributions to the seminars. Amos misunderstood the question for Summative 1 and wrote a good essay but not quite on message. He understands better now and hopes to improve on his formative 1 mark of 61%. I am confident he can get to over 70%.
Green,Mr. Amos' formative was not that good but I am confident he will do much better in his summative. He is however very passionate and dedicated towards studying Psychology and he will have no problems in his Sumamtive and work.

Green,"Junyu has demonstrated a high level of commitment to AES this term; his written work is extremely good and he generally makes a concerted effort to engage and focus in class.  In order to prepare fully for forthcoming AES examinations, and to achieve his evident potential in coursework assessments, Junyu should continue to develop his skills in synthesising material from research sources and on presenting them in a logical and coherent way.  This will be helpful in both the CW2 spoken presentation and the CW3 coursework essay.  Further support and information can be found on Moodle and in AES workbooks."
Green,Meng is a good student who pays attention to detail and works well independently.
Green,"Amos has a lot to offer although there have been some lapses in his attendance and punctuality.

He is a mature and sensible student who has plenty of potential. This was clear in his recent summative assignment for which he scored 72%.

His written English is good and largely fluent ad although his tenses are sometimes confused, this does from showing  a generally sophisticated grasp of the key issues related to why the first half of the twentieth century was dominated by war."
Green,Amos is a very bright and sensible young man who will have no issues with progressing. We can expect great things from him in the future.

Green,"Murtaza is a real pleasure to have in class. Bright, intelligent and highly-driven, he is not afraid to question concepts taught in class to further his learning and deepen his understanding of the principles of academic English. His formative AES assessment results indicate she has a very firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and is more than capable of putting them into practice. Provided he continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity, I have no doubts whatsoever that Murtaza’s summative results will be of an equally high standard and he will achieve progression requirements in all aspects of the AES module. During the Spring Break, Murtaza should start working on his AES research project so that he can get started on his CW1 as soon as Term 2 begins."
Green,Murtaza is a very motivated and committed student who is a pleasure to have in the class. He gets involved with class discussion and even asks questions. He is very focussed in class and he needs to maintain this level of concentration and not let himself get distracted by talking to his friends. His level of english is very good and this will only help him to succeed on the course.
Green,"Murtaza - you are attentive in class but at times you lose focus. I am pleased though that you are happy to answer questions in class. Your listening skills are also good and generally your work in class is of a good quality too. Well done! For your formative assessment, you have obviously taken the time to really do your research and it shows. This skill will be very useful in helping you to progress on to RH."
Green,"Murtaza is a good, capable and committed student. His contributions to class seminars and the overall quality of his work is very good. We discussed his mark of 71% for formative 1. He aims for 80% on summative 1. He is capable of this. In particular he will look at broadening his referencing and research to include academic journals."

Green,"Murtaza has continued to work hard this term and performed very well in his Listening exam and CW1. He shows excellent awareness of academic conventions governing research and academic writing and is able to put those into practice when completing his assignment. Provided he shows equal diligence in the last term of his studies, Murtaza will have no trouble whatsoever meeting progression requirements for his chosen degree at RHUL"
Green,"Murtaza is a very able student who participates in class. However, his motivation and attendance have fallen away in the last month or 2. Although if this trend continues he will put himself at risk of not progressing, I believe that Murtaza understands that in order to progress he will need to put in a decent effort."
Green,"Murtuza - You are a pleasure to teach, please be aware that there is always room for improvement and this is what you should be concentrating on – stretching you knowledge and understanding. Your formative 2 score is 84% and this is a very good result. If you can achieve something similar, or even higher, in your summative 2, you will do very well indeed and be able to progress to RH without much difficulty"
Green,"Murtaza is a good student who contributes well to seminars and is making steady progress.

For his recent summative assignment he received a mark of 75% for an essay that was written in a mature and very effective manner. The occasional errors did not detract from the overall quality of his work which showed a very good understanding and knowledge of the key concepts related to why wars dominated the first half of the twentieth century.


For  future work, he must make better use of more comprehensive research and further background reading."
