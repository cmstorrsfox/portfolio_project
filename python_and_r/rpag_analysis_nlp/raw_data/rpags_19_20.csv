Amber,"Illia participates in group activities with enthusiasm and works well with others, but often needs reminders and encouragement to begin tasks and remain focused in class. He is generally a considerate student who continues to have some difficulty completing homework assignments on time. Illia is encouraged to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude. Establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of Illia’s second term goals. His writing skills require further improvement. Therefore, it is recommended that he does independent study over his winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book. In Term 2, Illia should join academic writing workshops which will help him develop his writing skills."
Amber,Illia is a good student. He is confident and readily participates in class discussions. He is also very open to feedback which is good for his development. His first assignment was good (unfortunately it was subject to penalties which reduced the final mark) and this bodes well for his future success on the course. Illia must now work on the feedback from his assignment and continue to work with high energy.
Red,"You show some fair knowledge of understanding of the subject, your score is 37% you do actively participate at times in the class discussion, you have the potential to progress. You need to consistently make a reasonable effort, make a considerable amount of notes in class, revise material posted in Moodle you can improve the score, have submitted your assessment late so, deduction of 10% marks, bear in mind, try to organise your time and manage assessment on time. Your aim should be to improve your score by reading the materials posted on module handbook and memorise the glossary."
Amber,"Illia has always been very active in class. His comments reflect a good understanding of politics and his engagement shows a desire to deepen it. However, he needs to allocate more time for independent study, especially for reading more and improving his research skills."
Amber,"Illia makes frequent contributions to class discussions and works well as part of a group. However, during class time, Illia often needs reminders and encouragement to begin tasks and remain focused on the task at hand. His writing skills need further work and improvement as he scores on average approx. 40% in AES writing mock exams. Therefore, he must do independent study using resources available on the Moodle, complete mock exams as set by his tutor and submit the compulsory AES tasks every week. Illia must also remember to re-submit his CW1 in the summer in order to obtain a pass mark. If Illia continues to work on his academic skills development in term 3, he should increase his chances of progression to the UG course of his choice at Royal Holloway University of London."
Amber,"Illia remains a good student who enjoys the classes and participates well in general. He has developed well during the first 2 terms and now studies much more effectively. It is disappointing that his assessment was submitted late as this has reduced his mark from good to acceptable. However, if he can continue to develop and apply himself to his studies I expect him to complete the course successfully."
Pink,"Illia - You do show some understanding in class and are an active participant in too but sadly your summative-1 score is a little low than it should be (57%). While your results in assessments have been fair so far, they do not reflect your potential. I believe you need to improve your concentration level and draw more confidently on subject-specific terminology to refine and enhance you work. You should also engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and on Moodle."
Amber,"Illia's resit essay for the Summative Assessment 1 shows a very good progress in terms of knowledge, research skills and confidence to engage with topics in the field of politics. I appreciated a lot his class contributions which showed depth and an ability to contextualise the conceptual and theoretical discussions. I recommend that he devotes more time to independent study and completes his homework regularly."

Red,"Hankun is a quiet student who has engaged with the AES course to some extent over the duration of Term 1. Hankun is encouraged to express her opinion in class more often and come to class prepared. She continues to require regular assistance with many aspects of the academic programme and has some difficulty completing homework assignments on time. Therefore, establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of Hankun’s second term goals. It is recommended that Hankun does independent study over her winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to improve her chances of progression."
Red,"Hankun is a very good student who works systematically and focusses in class. However, her standard of english is poor and this is holding her back from performing better. Her first assignment was disappointing and she now needs to increase her efforts to improve her english if she is going to succeed this year."
Amber,"Hankun is a good student and her attendance has been very good.
She needs to participate more in the class, ask questions and demonstrate her homework solutions. Her assessment results were very good and she should continue like this in order to ensure progression."
Red,"You show some fair knowledge of understanding in your assessment. Your score is 48%, which is satisfactory but not high enough for you to meet your academic requirements. You need to actively participate in class discussions, should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You need to consistently make extra efforts, make a considerable amount of notes in class, revise material posted on Moodle so that you can improve your score. In particular, you need to improve your English language skills."
Red,"Hankun tries to participate in the group work activities set during AES classes. Based on her poor results of the continuous in-class assessment, Hankun was referred to the listening workshops. She is encouraged to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude, and express her opinion in class more often. Hankun has been advised to continue working on improving her comprehension and fluency in Academic English (especially her listening skills) and has attended the listening workshops over the duration of the past two terms. She also attended the AES Plus class over the duration of term 2. Hankun should continue to work on improving her reading, writing and listening skills with the use of Mock exams as well as independent study materials available on the Moodle."
Amber,"Hankun remains an organised and motivated student. However, her participation in class discussions and her ability to answer questions remain low. Hankun's biggest challenge is to develop her skill in English and her confidence. Her most recent assessment result was good and I believe that she has genuinely engaged with the feedback, which is a very good sign of future success. Whilst it will be necessary to maintain a high level of energy I am optimistic about Hankun's chance of success on the course."
Pink,"Hankun has not shown a good attendance during this term. For this reason Hankun should do a good revision of what is uploaded in Moodle regarding statistics and ask to have weekly tutorials with her tutor to ensure that she understands the new concepts and can demonstrate them in the assessments.
Her participation is poor as well. Her skills will only develop through application and practice. Hankun has potential to achieve a good mark in Maths but she has to work hard till the end of this term without losing contact with her tutor."
Pink,"Hankun - You show some understanding in class, you usually relatively quiet in class although. You should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You should be more focused on your aims and work harder to achieve them. Your summative-1 resit score is  63% Your results in assessments have been satisfactory so far.  Use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle"

Red,"Dekang tries to participate in the group work set during his AES classes. Based on the poor results of the continuous in-class assessment, Dekang was referred to the listening workshops which he attended throughout Term 1. He was also referred to the writing workshops as well as the Language Support sessions. Dekang shows determination to learn but needs to make more effort to actively contribute to class. His listening, writing and speaking skills require further improvement. It is recommended that Dekang does independent study over his winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book."
Red,"Dekang is a very quiet student and needs to participate more in class. The main issue for Dekang going forward is his language capability - this is absolutely crucial and if he is not able to make dramatic progress then I am quite concerned about his ability to succeed in the foundation year. His first assignment was good, given these language issues, and this is a positive sign that he may be able to make progress."
Red,"Dekang puts a good level of effort into his work and his attendance is excellent. However he needs to work harder.  A determined effort is needed to ensure his progression. He is usually very quiet in class, and that keeps him from achieving his full potential. He should participate more in class and ask questions. His assessment results have not met the required standard so far."
Red,"You show some fair knowledge of understanding in your assessment. Your score is 46%, which is satisfactory but not high enough for you to meet your academic requirements. You need to actively participate in class discussions, should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You need to consistently make extra efforts, make a considerable amount of notes in class, revise material posted on Moodle so that you can improve your score. In particular, you need to improve your English language skills."
Red,Dekang is an enthusiastic student who works well with others. He has demonstrated some improvement over the duration of term 2 with regards to participation in class and group activities. He is encouraged to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude. Dekang is also encouraged to express his opinion in class more often and make more regular contributions to class discussions. He has been advised to continue working on improving his comprehension and fluency in Academic English (especially his listening skills) and has attended the listening workshops over the duration of the past two terms. Dekang should use the materials for independent study on the Moodle as well as the Language Development section in the AES course book in order to further improve his chances of progression.
Pink,"Dekang has grown his confidence levels during the first 2 terms and this is good, but his language skills remain very low and probably too low for him to succeed on the course. There is now limited time for him to develop, but he must now double his effort on his english language skills if he has any chance of succeeding on the course. His understanding of key concepts remains very loose and this will also have to be addressed through structured and organised reading/review of material."
Amber,"Dekang has great attendance in the class. He has shown progression in Maths since the first term. He follows the tutor and he solves successfully the exercises during the class. He asks questions and he is interested. Dekang should work more on his english skills, as statistics include good level of language. Also he should not be quiet in the class. Dekang needs to continue his hard work and he is going to have good results."
Pink,"Dekang  - You show some understanding in class, but remain mostly silent in class. You should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas. You have a sound understanding of this subject and you should not be shy to get involve. Your summative-1 score was  61% and this is a good result for you. As you move forward, try and use more subject-specific terminology in your assessment as this will help refine your thinking. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and Moodle."

It has been noticed that she has had some difficulty adjusting to the academic expectations of the course. She demonstrates enthusiasm to learn but needs to make more effort to actively contribute to class. Based on the poor results of the continuous assessment (scores well below 40%), Shuang was referred to the listening workshops in Term 1. Her writing, listening and speaking skills require considerable improvement. Therefore, she was also referred to the writing workshops as well as the Language Support sessions. It is recommended that Shuang does independent study over her winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to improve her chances of progression."
Red,"Shuang is a motivated student who is committed to her studies, but her level of skill in english is low and this will make it difficult for her to succeed on the course. Her first assignment was disappointing and she now needs to consider the feedback carefully in order to develop her skill going forward. She must also work very hard on her english to give herself the best chance of succeeding this year."
Red,"You show some fair knowledge of understanding in your assessment, your score is 46% you need to actively participate in class discussion, should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You need to consistently make a reasonable effort, make a considerable amount of notes in class, revise material posted in Moodle you can improve the score. Need to improve your language skills. attend workshops regularly.

You were confused in the past  in submitting your assessment, please be careful with summative assignment"
Pink,"Shuang needs to focus on improving her English proficiency first. She works very hard and devotes a lot of time to this course. I have no doubt that her grade will substantially improve once her proficiency does. Due to health reasons, she missed a few classes lately. I am happy to prepare a plan to catch-up on the topics we discussed and a one-to-one tutorial next term."
Red,"During class time, Shuang often needs reminders and encouragement to begin tasks and remain focused on the task at hand. She is generally a considerate student who, however, continues to have some difficulty completing homework assignments on time. Shuang is encouraged to express her opinion in class more often (in English) and make more contributions to class discussions. She must continue working on improving her comprehension and fluency in Academic English (especially her listening skills) and has attended the listening workshops over the duration of the past two terms. Shuang has made some progress in terms of her reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where she was awarded a mark of 55%. However, her listening and writing skills need further development as she consistently scores below 40% in AES mock exams. Therefore, it is recommended that she does independent study using resources available on the Moodle every week and completes mock exams as set by her tutor."
Amber,"Shuang remains generally committed to her studies and her confidence has improved in term 2. However, her standard of english is still too low for her to succeed easily. Shuang has responded well to feedback and her most recent assessment has improved a great deal. This is to her credit and if she continues to take on feedback and work hard there is a chance that she can succeed on the course."
Pink,"Shuang - Your attendance is satisfactory, you show some understanding in class, You need to concentrate more in class you usually relatively quiet although.

Pink,"Caren's resit for the Summative Assessment 1 shows a progress in terms of knowledge, as well as ability to develop political science arguments.

Pink,"Ahmed shows a good learning attitude. His writing skills, however, need further development. I also advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. He is also advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard."
Red,Ahmad's key issue is concentrating in class. His first assignment result was disappointing and it is likely that this is a result of his lack of engagement and involvement in the classes. He does not participate in class discussions and is generally unable to answer questions when asked. He needs to listen carefully to the feedback from his first assignment and commit to focusing on his studies with much greater energy.
Amber,"You demonstrate some understanding of the subject. Your score is 61. You have to put in a good level of effort into your work, you lack motivation. You should avoid being on the phone for long, Please concentrated in class, and actively participate. You have potential to progress, do make a considerable effort of making notes in class your aim should be to improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Amber,"Ahmad's mark for the formative assessment 1 does not reflect his knowledge of politics and the ability to engage with various themes in class discussions. I recommend to allocate more time for independent study, and most importantly, for reading the assigned texts and doing the homework."
Pink,"Ahmad demonstrates good speaking skills and contributes, when present, to all class discussions. Ahmad has achieved above 50% in listening, speaking and reading grades, which is, however, still below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He is particularly struggling with his academic writing skills and therefore needs to work harder to improve on them. Attending virtual office hours and doing extra listening and writing tasks on Moodle are recommended to improve his chances of progression."
Red,"Ahmad has made very little progress in term 2. His assignment result was poor and his behaviour in class shows a lack of motivation and energy to study. He is very rarely concentrating on the class material and is often looking at his phone during classes. It is hard to tell if Ahmad has the talent to succeed on the course because he makes so little commitment to his studies. Having said that, there has been some small improvement in his attention levels, but given his weak performance so far he will need to make an enormous improvement if he is to succeed on the course overall."
Amber,"Ahmed Al-Thani -You have attended most of my classes this term and you are an active participant in most class discussions.  Though at times I believe you are distracted in class, you are nonetheless putting in some effort in your work. Your summative -1 score is 57% which is a little lower than it should be because your knowledge and understanding of the topics studies is sound. What needs to happen going forward though is to consolidate and broaden your knowledge base further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Amber,"Ahmad's essay for the Summative Assessment 1 has shown a great improvement. Increasingly, he has become more involved in the class discussions and his contributions were very valuable. He also showed great leadership skills. I recommend that he devotes more time to independent study and completes his homework regularly."

Amber,"Zecong is a hard-working and conscientious student. I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly in class. He listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. He is also fully engaged in class and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. His writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops and doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to him on Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression."
Red,Zecong is a very quiet student. He does not participate in class discussions and cannot answer questions when asked directly. His first assignment result was very disappointing. The key issue for Zecong is his lack of language skill. If he is to succeed during this year then he must commit to significantly increasing his language skills by practising.
Green,74% formative 1 result.  Zecong has made a good start to this course and performed well in this assessment.  He is a supportive member of the class who works with his peers to achieve the required solutions.
Pink,"You show some fair knowledge of understanding in your assessment, your score is 46% you need to actively participate in class discussion, should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You need to consistently make a reasonable effort, make a considerable amount of notes in class, revise material posted in Moodle you can improve the score. Need to improve your language skills."
Amber,"Zecong demonstrates good reading and listening skills and contributes, when present, to all class discussions. He has handed all of his homework in on time. Zecong has achieved above 50% in overall grades, which is slightly lower than the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. Zecong needs to work harder to improve his academic writing and speaking skills and doing extra writing tasks on Moodle is likely to improve his chances of progression."
Amber,"Zecong remains a very quiet student. He does not contribute to class discussions and finds it very difficult to answer questions when directly asked. His biggest issue remains his lack of skill in english. However, he did show some progress in his most recent assessment and if he can continue this trend and increase his capabilities further there is a chance that he can succeed on the course overall."
Green,Summative 1 result 70%.  Zecong has a consistent grade in the pure maths component of his course and demonstrates a good understanding.  He must now concentrate on the term 2 statistics component and ensure he understands all the terminology associated with this.
Amber,"Cai Zecong - While you have attended most of my classes this term, you don't take initiative to answer or participate in group discussions and this may be because you need to improve your communication skills. This is also true in terms of demonstrating your subject knowledge. Having said this, there is evidence that you are putting in some effort in your work - and this is mostly based on your summative -1 score (63%). I would like to therefore see your competence expressed in class more."

She shows willingness to learn but needs to make more effort to actively contribute to class. It is recommended that Yisu does independent study over her winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to improve her chances to progress."
Amber,"Yisu has shown excellent attendance in the Maths class. She is advised to participate more in the class and ask questions. Her skills will only develop through application and practice. She puts effort in her work but she needs to be more concentrated and work harder. Her results in assessments have been satisfactory so far. To ensure progression, she should work harder as she needs 70% in her maths exam."
Pink,Yisu is trying to engage and understand the concepts of Physics and the labs. She has a very good attendance. However she does not concentrate a lot and she does not participate in the class. She is a smart girl but she has to improve her communication skills and be a more active student.  Her report will improve and she will have better results if she follows the above advice.
Red,"Misha's level of attendance have been excellent.

However her participation in class has been very poor and a way to improve her skills is through more participation in class.

I am a bit afraid over her progress. She seems to have difficulty in adapting to alternative learning techniques she is not used to (i.e. a more critical approach to knowledge, not focusing too much on the book, etc.).

Her results have been poor. Her assessment was very descriptive, with no use of evidence or sources and no reference list."
Red,"Yisu has demonstrated some improvement over the duration of term 2 with regards to participation in class and group activities. She is encouraged to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude. Yisu is also encouraged to express her opinion in class more often and make more regular contributions to class discussions. She has been advised to continue working on improving her comprehension and fluency in Academic English (especially her listening skills) and use additional study materials to practise listening and note-taking skills in her independent study time. Her writing skills also require further work. Therefore, it is recommended that Yisu does independent study using resources available on the Moodle, completes mock exams as set by her AES tutor and submits all the compulsory AES tasks in order to further improve her chances of progression."
Pink,"Yisu has shown very good attendance during this term. Although Yisu has a good background in Maths, she does not participate in the class, she is not focused and she does not show her maths skills. She engages with her homework and she has potential. She should ask more questions and engage her communication skills during the class in order to improve her understanding. Yisu should work more and collaborate more closely with the tutor to ensure her progression to the university."
Pink,"Yisu has shown very good attendance in the Physics class. She is usually very quiet in class, and that keeps her from achieving her full potential. When she has questions she does not ask for clarifications. Her results in the lab report were good. In the formative assessment exam, Yisu showed that she had studied but she is still confused with the theory of physics. Yisu should participate more and engage with the homework in order to achieve a good grade to pass in the university."
Amber,"Misha's level of attendance has been excellent and she did get a very good grade in her summative 1.
She has nevertheless struggled through the Year with the teaching environment at RH and she has find it difficult to adopt in a different teaching environment than the one she is used to. 
The result of her F2 was not good and she needs to show commitment and determination by herself in order attain a progression mark."

Pink,Keitaro is a considerate and polite student who consistently demonstrates respect and consideration for his peers and tutors. He is an active participant in group learning activities. He usually investigates and obtains information independently. Keitaro has expressed an eagerness to do better and over the duration of Term 1 he has made some improvement in his overall academic performance. Keitaro is encouraged to participate more frequently in class discussions and share his findings on the forum. He should continue to attend the listening workshops as well as dedicate some time during his winter break to researching his CW1 to give himself a head start on researching the topic in Term 2.
Red,"Keitaro is a very quiet student. He is attentive and engaged in class, but he does not participate in class discussions. He does try to answer questions when asked directly, but is often unable to ask questions. His first assignment work was of a low standard and he will need to work hard going forward in order to succeed. The main issue for Keitaro is his language skill and this should be his main focus now so that he can make the most of the rest of the opportunities on the course."
Amber,"You demonstrate some understanding of the subject Your score is 56%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class. Usually, you not an active participant in class discussions Need to focus a little more in class. You need to make notes in class, please improve your concentration level in class, your performance can be better your aim should be to improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Pink,"Keitaro is a wonderful young man who has to come out of his shell.

His English is not that bad as he things and he has to gain the confidence to start talking in order to apply his learning skills more. 

He seems to be putting effort in studying and has been attending workshops as well. We have been wortking on his expression and on the way he writes and I believe this work will be reflected with his next work."
Amber,"Keitaro demonstrates good speaking skills and makes frequent contributions to class discussions. He usually investigates and obtains information independently and does well in terms of sharing his findings with the rest of the class. Keitaro is responsive to feedback and builds positive relationships with his peers and tutors. He achieved a score of 56% in the last writing mock exam and has made noticeable progress in terms of his reading and research skills, as demonstrated in CW1 where he was awarded a mark of 64%. However, his listening skills need further development as he scores on average approx. 40% in his listening assessments. What is more, Keitaro has been advised to continue working on improving his comprehension and fluency in Academic English and has attended the listening workshops over the duration of the past two terms. Keitaro should continue to work on improving his listening and note-taking skills with the use of Mock exams available in term 3."
Amber,"Keitaro remains a very quiet, but committed student. His result in the resit was relatively strong, and although this was not quite to the standard required it shows that he has put some good work in during term 2 and through this work has developed his knowledge and skill. If he is to succeed on the course he must maintain and increase this focus until the end of the course."
Amber,"Keitaro - You show some understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  64% Your results in assessments are good so far. Improve your concentration level. You should be more focused work hard to your potential use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle"
Pink,Keitaro has put some effort in improving his English communication but he needs to try to do that more and also by himself. I believe he is a smart young man with the only issue he faces being the level of English. He will be passing the course and although I am not sure he will be getting a progression mark he could easily get in to another English University.

Red,Yamei has improved over the duration of the term with regards to participation in class and group activities. She is encouraged to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude. She is an energetic and enthusiastic student who works well with others. Yamei is also encouraged to express her opinion in class more often and make more regular contributions to class discussions.  She has been advised to continue working on improving her comprehension and fluency in Academic English (especially her listening skills) over the winter break using the materials for independent study on Moodle as well as the Language Development section in the AES course book.
Red,Yamei is a very quiet student who does not participate in class discussions. When she is asked direct questions she is generally unable to answer. This indicates some lack of skill in language which makes it difficult for her to understand the concepts in class. Her first assignment was disappointing and this shows that she has considerable work to do in order to succeed on the course. Her main focus should be development of language skills.
Pink,"You show some fair knowledge of understanding in your assessment, your score is 44% you need to actively participate in class discussion, should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You need to consistently make a reasonable effort, make a considerable amount of notes in class, revise material posted in Moodle you can improve the score. Need to improve your language skills."
Amber,Yamei's formative essay showed a good understanding of the topics we study. She is conscientious and allocates time for independent study regularly. I recommend that she focuses on improving her English and engages more often in class discussions. Her contributions have been very insightful.
Pink,"In the classroom, Yamei helps to keep the work group focused and on task. The student co-operates consistently with the tutors and other students. Yamei shows self-direction in goal-setting and goal achievement, and has made some good progress over the past two terms. She is responsive to feedback, participates well in class activities and has built positive relationships with both her peers as well as tutors. What is more, Yamei has made noticeable progress in terms of her reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where she was awarded a mark of 70%. If she continues to work at this level in term 3, she should increase her chance of progression to her chosen UG course at Royal Holloway University of London."
Pink,"Yamei has made some improvements this term. She remains very quiet, but has done some good work for her first summative assessment. This still remains at a level that is too low for progression, but compared to her work in term 1 it is an improvement. The question remains whether she can continue to improve and the key to this is probably her level of skill in english. Yamei must focus on her studies more than ever if she is going to have any chance of succeeding."
Amber,"Yamei - You show some understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  64 % Your results in assessments have been good so far.  Improve your concentration level. You should be more focused work hard to your potential use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle."
Green,"Yamei's essay for the Summative Assessment 1 shows an impressive progress. She has gained a very good knowledge and understanding of politics and good academic writing skills. As the last two assessments are oral ones, I recommend that in addition to completing the assigned homework, she also devotes more time to improving her verbal communication skills."

Pink,"Max demonstrates good reading and listening skills and contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. However, he needs to be more focused on the content in class and revise the concepts introduced so far so that he has a good understanding of them. His writing skills also need further development. Attending writing workshops and doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to him on Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression."
Red,"You make frequent contributions to class in Arts, but as we discussed in your tutorial these need to be a bit more focussed - relating to the specific texts we are studying. We have also discussed your assignment, which was problematic in a number of ways; not only was it too long, but you handed in a late coversheet. These are all things for you to work on in the new term so that you can maximise the promise you undoubtedly have."
Amber,"You are dedicated to Music as a discipline, but sometimes struggle to concentrate on the matter at hand in class. When you are doing work together, you should try and make some more notes as these will help you in the future. Your assignment showed a solid understanding of the main concepts, but you need to build on these further, using some secondary literature in order to score better next time."
Pink,"max is a very talented young man but he is letting himself down with his low level of effort.

His attendance has been generally very good, but he tends to miss the first hour of his seminar on Fridays every other week because he has piano training. I have asked him to change his schedule as it disrupts his seminar but his response was vague and unclear.

His participation is generally very good.

Max needs to put more effort into examining the content we cover in class, making notes and in independent study. While he is very bright, he has taken University studying very lightly and is not focused.

This is reflected also in his assessment, which was a fail due to plagiarism, short and incomplete answer, and no submission form."
Red,"Max demonstrates good reading and listening skills and contributes, when present, to all class discussions. However, Max did not submit his coursework 1, which makes it a bit hard for him to progress with the current results. Max demonstrates poor progress being made on his academic writing skills; therefore, he needs to work harder to improve them. It is imperative he attends all his AES classes from now on. Attending virtual office hours and doing additional independent writing tasks on Moodle are recommended to improve his chances of progression."
Red,"You struggle somewhat in Arts. Your Summative 1 was problematic and you did not submit a Formative 2 at all. Moreover, you have not replied to any requests for a tutorial so we have not been to discuss this at all. This means that preparation for your Summative 2, which is the most important assessment of the course, is currently behind. You need to start engaging with the texts we are reading in order to improve your marks in Arts."
Red,"You have struggled with recent assignments, including reading word limits. You need to make sure you understand the question - and if you don't, ask for further clarification. You do, however, remain dedicated to the subject, which is good to see. The next few weeks are a really important time, so it is crucial that you maintain your focus and try and make sure that your Summative 2 is a successful assignment."
Pink,"Max has not been putting adequate effort in his learning (no note-taking, lateness, etc.). He is constantly watching videos concerning things that interest him on his phone (he seems obsessed with the Hong Kong-China situation) and when he contributes to class his comments are sometimes off topic and always seeking to introduce his concerns in discussions in class. 
His assessments were not good and he seems to be overwhelmed with the learning environment in England. He seems unable to adapt and focus his attention on learning as he is too occupied with extra-curricula activities and concerns."

Red,"Vera demonstrates poor learning attitude and there is little evidence of progress being made in the AES course. When present, she tends to be quiet in lesson discussions; she is not focused on the content and shows little understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Lack of engagement in the class activities makes it hard for her to progress, coupled with the poor results from her formative assessments so far. It is imperative that she attends all her AES classes from now on and should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements."
Pink,"Despite a very good formative mark, you seem to be struggling in Arts. This is due to poor attendance and a poor attitude, which we have discussed in your tutorial. However, as we agreed, you are going to try to do better in the New Year, which was good to hear. As you have done some good work for me in your assignment, I hope that this will be replicated in your summative assignment, especially with increased engagement with the subject."
Pink,"Vera is very quiet in class and makes little effort to contribute to class discussion without prompting. Her attendance has also been problematic - and she needs to work hard to ensure that she does not fall behind in music. Her formative assignment shows that she can apply her learning, but she needs to focus on the feedback to ensure that scores better next time. If Vera works very hard, then this could have good results, but will require a change of attitude."
Red,"Vera has had multiple issues throughout this term. 

Her levels of attendance are not good. Given that her English language skills are not that good, the more classes she misses the further behind she will be in terms of knowledge and understanding. 

She rarely participates in class and seems to be constantly 'travelling away'. Even if I directly ask her something, she finds it improssible to respond. 

I do not see any effort from her in trying to progress this course.

While she managed to gain a pass mark in the assessment, I find it impossible for her to progress given her work ethic."
Red,"Xueying demonstrates poor learning attitude and has made little progress in the AES module. When present, she tends to be quiet in lesson discussions, although she shows some understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She needs to work harder to improve her English language skills, writing, listening and speaking skills in particular. It is imperative that she attends all her AES classes from now on. Attending virtual office hours and doing additional independent learning tasks are strongly recommended to help her meet the overall English language requirement."
Pink,"You did well in Summative 1 - well done. However, your Formative 2 was not as successful and we have discussed what you need to do in order to improve that work. You need to read the primary texts and engage with the secondary literature. Meanwhile, in class it would be good to hear more from you - not just when I ask you for a contribution - but spontaneously. You have the ability to do better with this, so it would be good to see it."
Red,"You have managed to improve your Summative 1 mark somewhat. However, your Formative 2 mark is problematic, mainly because you misunderstood what was asked of you. You need to work very hard in Music if you want to be successful in the final part of the course. You will need to focus on taking part in class, keeping up with the online work - and making sure you understand what is asked of you for the assignment and completing it to the best of your ability."
Pink,"Vera's has not shown adequate commitment and determination to attain a progression mark. I am surprised she actually gained a passing grade for her S1 resit. 
She has not taken University education seriously and she sometimes seems overwhelmed with University requirements. She is unable to even articulate a sentence in English during class. If she is having such difficulties with Foundation Year, she will find it extremely difficult at Undergraduate."

Red,Yiwen demonstrates some understanding of the material covered in class. She attempts to make short contributions to class discussions and she has been attending the listening workshops in Term 1. She was also referred to the writing workshops in order to help her make improvements to her academic writing. Both her writing and listening skills need further development. Yiwen has scored below 40% in all her in-class listening assessments to date. Attending writing and listening workshops and doing extra homework from the Language Development section of the AES course book is likely to improve her chances of progression.
Amber,"Yiwen is a good student who is generally attentive and focussed in class. However, she does not participate in class discussions and is normally unable to answer questions when asked directly. Her language needs some development going forward if she is to achieve more. Her first assignment result was good and she will need to work hard to maintain this level of achievement."
Pink,"You have some fair knowledge of the topics that have been covered in class. You demonstrate some understanding of the subject, but you need to actively participate in the class discussion. Your score is 55%, which means that you need to use your potential to the maximum. It would be helpful if you make a considerable amount of notes to revise after class, please put that into good use. While writing assignments, you need to make a flow chart with the notes written by yourself, revise material posted on Moodle. Last but not least, you need to improve your language skills."
Amber,"Loralai's level of attendance is very good. 

Participation is satisfactory but she can practice and apply more the skills she learns if she tries to speak more in class.

She seems to be putting a good level of effort in her work but can improve in that by taking better notes (rather than always asking Lingzhi) and through independent study.

Her results have been satisfactory but she needs to improve in order to progress."
Pink,"Yiwen is a considerate and polite student who consistently demonstrates respect and consideration for her peers and tutors. In term 2, Yiwen has become an active participant in group learning activities. She usually investigates and obtains information independently, and has expressed an eagerness to do better. Over the duration of term 2, Yiwen has made some improvement in her overall academic performance, particularly, in terms of her academic writing skills. Yiwen is encouraged to participate more frequently in class discussions and share her findings on the class forum. She should continue to work on improving her reading and listening skills with the use of Mock exams as well as independent study materials available on the Moodle."
Pink,"Yiwen is a very quiet student. Her biggest issue remains her weak language skills. In general she does not contribute to class discussions and is unable to answer questions when asked directly. Her assessment during term 2 showed some progress, but this is likely not to be enough if she is to succeed on the course overall. Yiwen needs to work harder than ever if she is to get through the course successfully."
Amber,"You show some understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  64%. Your results in assessments have been good so far. You need to now refine your work and draw in more subject-specific terminology into your work. To improve your score even further, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and Moodle"
Amber,"While Loralai's summative assignment was in the range of very good (62), she needs to keep up with her effort in order to attain a progression mark. 

Her F2 was quite bad which might be connected to the fact that she did not understand what was expected of her in this assignment."

Red,"Jincheng is a friendly student who gets along well with his peers. He approaches new tasks reluctantly and often needs tutor’s prompts, encouragement and reminders to begin and complete the task. Based on the poor results of the continuous in-class assessment (score below 40%), Jincheng was referred to the listening workshops in Term 1, which he should continue to attend in Term 2. His listening, writing and speaking skills require further improvement. For this reason, he was also referred to the writing workshops as well as the Language Support sessions. Jincheng seems to require regular assistance with many aspects of the academic programme. It is recommended that Jincheng does independent study over his winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to improve his chances of progression."
Pink,"Your assignment mark in Arts was good, showing that you have a solid foundation on which to build for the summative. However, in Arts classes on Mondays you often fall asleep - this is something you need to change immediately. This is not helping your participation; you need to ensure you are well-rested so you can participate actively in class discussions as well as group work (where you are much better). However, hopefully in the New Year you will be able to improve this."
Pink,"Jingcheng is a lovely student who is well mannered and tries hard in and out of class. Unfortunately, the language barrier for him is significant and he must attend AES workshops, as well as work outside of class himself, to improve his English communication. Nonetheless, Jincheng shows some creativity and an ability to achieve a respectable grade when he dedicates himself to his studies. His recent presentation on documentaries was good and a good example of when research really paid off. I would advise Jincheng to keep revising his notes, and work closely with his classmates to ensure work is completed and understood fully."
Pink,"Jincheng's levels of attendance is good but he can improve on that. 

The same goes for his level of participation. He should stop sitting in the back row in the lecture (and also in the seminar but to a less degree) as the back row does not allow you to pay attention to the subject.

He needs to increase his effort in studying and try to engage more with our discussions. He has to show more determination and effort.

His assessment results were fair but he can improve if he follows the guidelines above."
Red,"Jincheng has demonstrated some improvement over the duration of term 2 with regards to participation in class and group activities. He is encouraged to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude. Jincheng is also encouraged to express his opinion in class more often and make more regular contributions to class discussions. He has been advised to continue working on improving his comprehension and fluency in Academic English (especially his listening skills) and use additional study materials to practise listening and note-taking skills in his independent study time. His writing skills also require further work. Therefore, it is recommended that Jincheng does independent study using resources available on the Moodle, completes mock exams as set by his AES tutor and submits all the compulsory AES tasks in order to further improve his chances of progression."
Pink,"Your Summative 1 was very good - well done. Your Formative 2 had some problems, which we have discussed - and hopefully you can learn from these to ensure that your Summative 2 is more successful. However, in the meantime there are a variety of things you can do to try and ensure success. You need to ensure that you read the primary texts carefully - and additionally read some secondary literature to back up your knowledge. With the transition to online learning, it is especially important you take responsibility for your own learning in this way."
Amber,"Jincheng is a mild-mannered and polite student. His language level poses a significant challenge to his completing this course successfully, but aside from this he shows some grasp of how visual material is used to convey a narrative or message. For this reason I have some faith that Jincheng may do better than expected in this subject, but my strong advice would be for him to spend as much time as he can absorbing good vocabulary and writing style from model answers and academic sources."
Amber,Jincheng has improved a lot in terms of his assignments as his S1 resit was at 65. I have to admit however that apart from this he has not shown me anything else. His level of commitment and participation was the same and I did not see any sort of change in his learning. I am looking forward to see whether he will be able to attain a progression mark.

Red,"Sam is not always focused on his AES classes and shows limited understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term; he makes little progress in listening, writing and speaking, which need extra effort to improve. There is a substantial gap between the student's exam results and the entry requirements, which he should work extra hard to keep up with. It is important he tries to be more actively engaged in class. Speaking more English, doing extensive listening exercises, attending writing and listening workshops and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Your attendance in Arts has been good. However, you are reluctant to participate in classes which is problematic. In order to gain more from classes you need to take a more active role in discussions - both in groups and also in full class discussions. Your formative result was nonetheless good, showing what you can achieve when you put your mind to it. Next term, I would like to see greater and better participation from you so that you can build on your work for your summative assignment."
Pink,"Sam is a creative individual and if he showcases his creativity more, he can very likely pass and progress on this module. However, his level of English is his biggest challenge. My advice to Sam is to attend as many AES workshops as possible and to also work outside of class to practice writing and speaking in English."
Pink,"I am not certain of Sam's ability to progress. While his attendance has been generally very good, his participation is very patchy. I often catch him doing other things rather than paying attention while often the first thing he does is try to translate things.

His level of English is not that advance and he needs to really improve his learning skills in order to progress. He will be able to pass (at least I believe so) but he needs to do major improvement if he is to progress."
Red,"Sam demonstrates poor learning attitude and has made little progress in the AES module. When present, he tends to be quiet in lesson discussions, although he shows some understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Sam's CW1 result was very disappointing and will make it hard for him to progress unless he resubmits it in the July resit session. He needs to work harder to improve his writing, reading and listening skills. It is imperative that he attends all his AES classes from now on. Attending virtual office hours and doing additional independent learning tasks on Moodle are strongly recommended to help him to meet the overall English language requirement."
Amber,"You did well in Summative 1 - so well done. You were not quite as successful in Formative 2 but hopefully have learnt what you can do in order to improve your work for Summative 2. In class, you have started to contribute more which has been a welcome development - well done. This should help you with your preparation for Summative 2 - and it would be good to see this continue with the online sessions."
Red,"While Sam is a lovely student, his language level has posed a significant barrier to his learning. His relatively mediocre performance in his summative 1 has put him at some disadvantage and I am concerned that without strong efforts on his part he will not be able to progress on to his chosen degree. My advice would be for Sam to study carefully the learning outcomes for summative 2 and ensure that he demonstrates his learning clearly. I also suggest that he takes a more proactive approach and submits drafts of his work to me for advice and guidance."
Pink,"Sam has struggled with English language throughout the year. He seems to be a smart young man but his level of English will not allow him to progress at Royal Holloway. His S1 resit was a fail and his S1 was in the range of 44. While he might be able to pass, I am not sure he will be able to progress."

Red,"Mohammed is an attentive and enthusiastic student in AES classes but sometimes he can find it hard to follow the lesson and complete the tasks on time. He could benefit from reading the class materials before the day and he should also review term 1 material on Moodle over the winter break and do some extra reading and writing activities to practise what he learnt in Term 1, which will help him perform better in term 2."
Red,14% formative 1 result.  Mohammed tries hard in class to achieve the correct answers but has some fundamental misunderstandings at a very basic level which hinders his ability to retain concepts and perform at the appropriate level.  Mohammed would benefit from having a formal detailed assessment of his needs.
Red,Mohammed has shown a good attendance in the Physics class. He is interested in the class and participates. However he needs more work in order to meet the requirements of pass/progression. His report does not include any analysis of the data and description of the underlying physics. After our feedback meeting he should try harder to meet the criteria of the Physics lab report.
Red,Mohammed has missed some classes because of an illness. In his exam did not perform well. The exam covered topics from the week 1 till the week 7 so I do not think that his absences are the reason for his low score. He needs more studying and some help in order to show some improvement in Maths.
Pink,"Mohammed demonstrates good listening skills and tries to contribute to class discussions. Although he is quite active in group work tasks, he might be distracted during individual work due to the complexity of the task so it is important to come to class prepared to be able to participate more and benefit more from AES classes. Doing some extra pratice on Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression."
Red,"Mohammed tries his best at all times to achieve a successful outcome to his problem solving but he has difficulty retaining the knowledge needed, especially when under pressure, and has difficulty answering questions on basic underlying concepts.  His attendance is exemplary and he has attended some workshops for extra support."
Red,"Mohammed has shown very good attendance in the class. He is usually very quiet and he finds it very difficult to show his knowledge during in class. His results in the physics lab report were very good. He demonstrated a good level of understanding and he made a good analysis. However, for the formative assessment, Mohammed did not perform well. He needs to study harder for physics and engage with the homework that is given to him."
Red,"Mohammed has a good attendance in the class. During the class, his participation is poor. His skills will only develop through application and practice. He does not engage with the homework and his results in the assessments were not good.
Mohammed needs more work and make sure that he is able to solve exercises that are demonstrated during the class. He should start from the basic principles first, study, practise with the homework and then continue with more advanced exercises. Also Mohammed should ask questions more often in the class or ask fro tutorials to help his understanding."

Amber,"Khalid shows interest and determination to learn but needs to make more effort to actively contribute to class discussions. His reading and listening skills have improved significantly since the beginning of the term, however, his writing and speaking skills require further improvement. It is important that he engages in independent study over the winter break using the resources available to him on Moodle and in his AES textbook."
Red,20% formative 1 result.  Khalid joined the course late and has not put in the effort needed to catch up and achieve well in the course.  I believe he is capable of much more and must attend workshops to improve his chance of success in the next assessment.
Red,"Khalid has shown poor attendance in the class. His skills will only develop through practice and application. He needs to work harder and participate more in the class. 
His report skills need more work and effort for improvement. He should revise AS skills for his report."
Red,Khalid is a student that has potentials to have a good grade. However his attendance is not good and he does not concentrate in the class. He does not do his homework and this does not help him to improve. If he changes his attitude and he tries more he has potentials.
Amber,"Khalid shows determination to learn but he needs to make more effort to improve his weaker skills, namely reading and writing. He has improved since the beginning of the term 1; however, his weaker skills require further improvement. It is important that he engages in independent study using resources available to his on Moodle and in his AES textbook. He can also do the mock exams, which can be found on Moodle."
Pink,Khalid is a confident young man but needs to engage fully with his studies to ensure a successful outcome.  He was absent from both formative assessments and his level of attendance does not support his studies.  Khalid has not taken advantage of the workshops offered.  In term 3 Khalid must engage fully to catch up and ensure his assessments are completed on time..
Pink,"In physics Khalid is a good student. Hi has shown progression in comparison with the previous term in his attendance, interest and participation. His lab report was very good. Khalid did not attend the formative assessment in Physics. This would be a good opportunity for him to test his knowledge and his exam writing skills. In general, Khalid shows that he has a good background in physics but he should not lose his focus and try for his best."
Red,"Khalid did not have good attendance during this term in Maths. This resulted on a low mark in the Maths assessment. Khalid has potential and when participates in the class he is showing good progress. However, he should attend more often, and when this is not possible, he should check the moodle page or contact the tutor  for advice on what to study for the topic that he has missed. He needs hard work to ensure his progression. If he follows this advice, he can have good results in his assessments."

She should do some independent study over the break time and refer to the sources available on moodle and in her AES textbook."
Red,24% formative 1 result.  Hala finds it difficult to commit to taking part in problem solving in class and this is reflected in the low result in this first assessment.  Hala will only improve this result with dedication to independent study and avoiding distractions in class.
Green,"You have a very good command of the subject. This is clearly shown in your score, which is 70%. You put in a good level of effort in your work and are mostly engaged in class. Your performance is strong but you need to stretch yourself further. To do this, be attentive in class, concentrate more and focus. Please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook. You need to improve your attendance too."
Green,"Hala has had a slight issue with attendance as she has been late to classes.

Her level of participation in class is very good.

She seems to be putting a very good level of effort in her studying.

Her assessment was good but she can do much better if she shows adequate amount of determination and enthusiasm."
Amber,"Hala has been a good student following her tutor`s advice since the beginning of the term, which is reflected on her formative exam positively, however her presentation skills require further improvement. She can practise presentation language and critical thinking using different topics. She can also refer to moodle for reference. Reviewing term 1 and 2 materials on moodle will also help her perfom better in term 3 and AES CW3."
Pink,"Summative 1 result 27%.  Hala has shown more commitment in term 2 to engaging in class activities.  However, she still has some way to go and must continue to practtise problem solving independently and seek support as needed.  The minimum Hala needs to achieve is 45% and this is possible with the right amount of effort."
Green,"Hala - You have a good command of the subject. It is clearly shown in your summative resit score which is 74%. You put in a commendable level of effort in the work but at times you are distracted in class. Your performance is strong but could be improved by pushing yourself further. Try to revise topics taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and Moodle page."
Green,"Hala will have no issues with progressing; nevertheless, she needs to pay attention to her level of commitment and overall attitude in terms of learning. Her attitude often seems laid back, as if she is not taking this seriously. She can improve on this by showing more determination and commitment (not being late, attendance, etc.). Once more, I want to reiterate that despite the above comments she will have no problems with progressing."

She has experienced good progress in many areas of her academic study this term. She shares her ideas and research skills in preparing for group presentations and is a co-operative, responsible individual. Careful planning and a conscientious attitude are positive aspects of her class participation and behaviour. Razan is to be congratulated on her achievements and encouraged to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout Term 2."
Amber,"Razan is a very good student. She is attentive and focused in class. She also participates in class discussions very well, demonstrating a good grasp of the key concepts. Her first assignment reflected this understanding and was a very good result. I expect Razan to have a very successful year as long as she listens to her feedback and maintains this high level of motivation."
Red,28% formative 1 result.  Razan must be prepared to work independently both in and out of class.  Attendance at the workshops will support her learning to improve the understanding of some of the difficult concepts she will meet in this course.  Razan is capable of achieving more but it will take effort.
Green,"You have a very good command of the subject. This is clearly shown in your score, which is 74%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong but you need to stretch yourself further.

Razan is to be congratulated on her achievements and encouraged to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout Term 3. Razan worked hard in Term 2 in order to improve her writing skills and managed to achieve a mark of 65 in her last mock writing exam taken during class time. What is more, the student has made noticeable progress in terms of her reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where she was awarded a mark of 73%. If Razan continues to work at this level next semester, then she should achieve the required progression mark of 50% in Writing, pass the programme and achieve the grades needed for progression to her UG course at RHUL."
Green,"Razan is doing very well on the course. Her energy and involvement in class is high and her contributions are insightful and helpful to the group. Her first assessment results have been good and I expect her to do well on the course overall. She undertook the group presentation work very well. She had some initial reservations about the composition of the group, but has succeeded in working well with her fellow students. Their work was of a very high standard and this is largely due to Razan's drive and energy within the group. Overall,  in order to develop she should work on her confidence in developing arguments and critical thinking (in addition to her already good performance in this area)."
Amber,"Razan found the mathematical component of her course difficult initially but has shown a considerable improvement over this term.  Her summative 1 result was 57% and together with the expected summative 2 result covering the statistical component of the course, Razan is on target exceed the required target grade. Razan is to be commended for the effort she has made."
Green,"Razan - You have a very good command of the subject. This is clearly shown in your summative score, which is 74%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong but you need to stretch yourself further. Try to revise the topics taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and Moodle page."

Amber,"Bassam welcomes new tasks and seeks new opportunities for learning. However, at times he needs encouragement to work to the best of his ability. He also needs reminders to stay focused on the task at hand. Bassam continues to seek teacher's clarification for assignments and is encouraged to include more detail and consider the marking criteria in completing his final work. He is also encouraged to ask questions to clarify meaning and ensure understanding. Greater focus in class would help improve the quality of his academic work. Based on the results of continuous formative assessment, it has been noted that his writing skills require further improvement. Therefore, he should continue working on his academic writing skills and take on board the feedback he has received so far. It is recommended that Bassam does independent study over his winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book."
Green,"Bassam is an excellent student. He is fully engaged in class, participates fully and has a good grasp of the necessary concepts. His first assignment results were very good and reflect this good work. Bassam is a pleasure to have in the class and as long as he maintains this level of motivation he is likely to do very well on the course."
Red,"12% formative 1 result.  Bassam does not enjoy mathematics largely because he does not understand the concepts in this first unit.  He must attend the workshops and be prepared to study independently, bringing problems back to class or a workshop."
Green,"You are a pleasure to teach. You have an excellent command of the subject. This is clearly shown in your score, which is 76%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,"In term 2, Bassam made some academic gains in the AES course. He demonstrates a positive attitude to learning, continues to seek clarification for assignments and shows diligence towards his projects. Bassam works well independently and in a group-work setting. He has made noticeable progress in terms of his reading and research skills, as demonstrated in CW1 where he was awarded a mark of 73%. In his academic writing, Bassam should incorporate greater detail into his written work in order to maximise his chances to obtain the required marks. He is also encouraged to make good use of the Mock Exams as well as independent study tasks available to students on the Moodle every week."
Green,"Bassam continues to develop well. He is an excellent student. Bassam contributes very well to class discussions and is a valuable member of the student group. His grasp of concepts, whilst still developing, is very good and he has a great ability to join together a variety of concepts to develop arguments. I am very optimistic about Bassam's future success on the course."
Amber,Summative 1 result 47%.  Bassam's summative 1 result demonstrates the level of effort he has made to improve his formative 1 grade.  He has attended workshops and consistently asks questions and checks his work.  Well done Bassam for showing what is possible if you really want to be successful.
Green,"Bassam - You are a pleasure to teach, you are active in class and do participate in the class decisions. Your summative-1 score is 80%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. Try to revise the topic taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle page."

Green,"Muska is a co-operative student who willingly participates in class activities. This term, Muska has made some academic gains in her AES course. She demonstrates a positive attitude to learning, continues to seek clarification for assignments and shows diligence towards her projects. Muska works well independently and in a group work setting. She is encouraged to incorporate greater detail in all her written work in order to maximise success. She is also encouraged to express her views on a given topic more often during class discussions to further develop and practise leadership abilities. Muska should dedicate some time during her winter break to researching her CW1 to give herself a head start on researching the topic in Term 2."
Amber,"Muska is a good student who is focussed and attentive in class. She has a high standard of english and this helps her understanding of the topics taught in class. She does not normally participate in class discussions, but when asked she is able to answer questions. Her first assignment was of a reasonably good standard, but she needs to listen carefully to the feedback to improve her results in the future. Overall I am very optimistic about Muska's success on the course going forward."
Red,22% formative 1 result.  Muska will be disappointed with this result and in particular the loss of marks given for one concept that must be revised and learned as part of this course.  Attendance at the workshops will be required in the next term to prepare for the next assessment.  Muska needs to pay attention to the algebraic concepts to move forward in this first area of mathematics encountered on the course.
Green,"You demonstrate some command of the subject Your score is 66%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and you need to be better engaged in class. You need to focus a little more in class. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. Improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Green,"Muska is respectful of other students in the classroom as well as wider student community.  She shows initiative and looks for new ways to get involved. With regard to her academic results, Muska consistently scores 60% (and above) for writing in the continuous formative assessment. She is responsive to feedback and builds positive relationships with her peers and tutors. What is more, Muska has made noticeable progress in terms of her reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where she was awarded a mark of 73%. Muska is to be congratulated on her achievements and encouraged to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout term 3."
Green,Muska is a very good student. Her level of engagement appears to have improved during term 2 and her most recent assessment was good. Having said that I still think that with greater energy and commitment Muska could achieve even higher marks. She has excellent English and when fully engaged her ability to articulate and argue ideas is very good. I am very optimistic about her overall success on the course.
Pink,"Summative 1 result 19%.  Muska is not finding pure mathematics particularly easy and he formative and summative results are almost the same demonstrating very little change in understanding.  Muska needs to take advantage of the extra help offered, such as workshops, and be more prepared to seek help when finding a concept difficult.  Muska must review the summative 1 paper and ensure she understands everything before taking the resit."
Amber,"Muska - You are a pleasure to teach, you are active in class and do participate in the class decisions at times. Your summative-1 score is 68%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work.  Use your knowledge of study concentrate more on subject-specific terminology. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. Try to concentrate more on subject-specific terminology in the topic taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle pages."

Red,"Iris shows determination to learn, but needs to make more effort to actively contribute to class discussions. There is a substantial gap between the student's exam results and the entry requirements, which she should work extra hard to keep up with. She has attended all recommended workshops, but her listening and writing require further improvement. Speaking more English, doing extensive listening exercises, attending writing and listening workshops and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Pink,"You have worked very hard in Arts this term and your progress has been plain to see. You have relatively well in your Arts assignment, giving you a strong foundation on which to build for your summative assignment - so well done. If you carry on as you are, you should continue to make progress. As we have discussed in your tutorial, the next step is for you to start speaking more in class - at the moment you are too quiet. Greater participation would mean that your learning would develop further - and thus give you the possibility of further achievement."
Pink,"You have worked very hard this term in music and the improvement in your work is visible - well done! Although you have a long way to go in music, you are very much on the right path. The next steps are to start participating more in class and in group discussions; this may seem scary, but it would really help your work. Your formative assignment showed the foundation of this work - and if you build on this for your summative, you should do better."
Pink,"Iris' attendance in class has been excellent. 

The same cannot be said of her participation however. It would be good and would only benefit her if she tries to speak more in class and apply what she learns during the class. Her level of English will not only improve if she tries to use it more. 

She seems to be putting a good level of effort in her studies but this needs to improve in order to guarantee a progression mark. 

Her assessment was good but needs to improve. This can only be done by putting more effort in her studying and improving her English language skills."
Pink,"Iris is a hard-working and conscientious student. She listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. I advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. Iris has achieved over 60% in CW1 but she still needs to work harder to improve her writing, listening and speaking skills. Attending virtual office hours and doing additional independent learning tasks on Moodle are recommended so as to help her meet the overall English language requirement and the sub-requirement in writing for her chosen degree."
Green,"You have worked very hard indeed in Arts, so well done. This has really paid off, meaning that your marks have really improved and you have very good marks for both Formative 2 and Summative 1: you should be very pleased. This gives you a very good foundation for your final assignment: carry on engaging with the primary text and secondary literature in order to continue this trend. You have also started to participate more in class which has been a delight to see: please keep this up, as it has been instrumental in your development."
Green,"You have worked incredibly hard in Music and have been rewarded with a trajectory of ever-improving marks: well done. This is an achievement of which you should be proud. Try and participate a bit more in class (as you have been in Arts) to help further and ensure that you continue to be successful. Otherwise, you should continue to reflect on your practical skills as well as the way in which you write about Music, in order to prepare for Summative 2."
Amber,"Iris has improved a lot throughout this year. While initially she seemed overwhelmed by learning here, she has picked up and has shown a lot of improvement. This is reflected also with her assignments, as her S1 was 59. I believe she is able of attaining a progression mark with a bit more effort."

Green,"Obaid is a real pleasure to have in class. Bright, intelligent and highly-driven, he is not afraid to question concepts taught in the AES module to further his learning and deepen his understanding of the principles of academic English. His critical thinking skills and eloquence make him particularly successful in academic debates and other forms of argumentative discourse, though it is important that he continues working on communicating his points in appropriate academic register. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented him and his classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, Obaid’s performance in the mock assessments throughout the term indicates has a very firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and can employ a range of appropriate exam strategies to his academic advantage. 
Provided he continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity, I am confident that Obaid’s summative results will be of an equally high standard."
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment. I am extremely worried about Obaid. His test result is extremely low (14%). His Maths level is not good. He is often late for classes, he is easily distracted during the classes, he doesn't attend the workshops regularly. He could not keep up with the work in regular class and does not memorise the rules and techniques. I am afraid that without extra tuition Omar will not be able to achieve reasonable results."
Pink,"Obaid is a clever student but his attendance is not good for the first term. He did not submit his report for the Physics lab as well.
When he participates in the class, he shows that he is capable of achieving a good grade in physics. However if he wants to reach this point,  he should work harder, do significant independent study and engage with the homework. Obaid should improve his attendance in the next term and engage with his homework and his assessments. These two actions are essential for his progress. Workshops are considered to be given to Obaid for his improvement in Physics."
Red,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment. I am extremely worried about Obaid. His test result is extremely low (18%). His Maths level is not good. He is often late for classes, he is easily distracted during the classes, he doesn't attend the workshops regularly. He could not keep up with the work in regular class and does not memorise the rules and techniques. I am afraid that without extra tuition Omar will not be able to achieve reasonable results."
Green,"Obaid is a bright and enthusiastic student, who shows a keen interest in classes. He demonstrates good skills in all areas. Especially his critical thinking skills are quite effective. However, he should be able to apply these skills to his writing as well so that he can write successful argumentative essays. He participates in most class activities and group discussions when he attends the sessions but he should be attending the live sessions more regularly."
Red,These comments are based on the student's performance. Obaid did not attend a single Applied Mathematics class since the move to the on-line system. He did not do the formative 2 test. I am very worried that Obaid will not be able to catch up will all the materials he missed and pass the summative assessments.
Amber,"Obaid did very well in his physics report for the summative 1 assignment. However Obaid does not attend all the classes in Physics and he does not engages with his homework. Obaid should be more focused on his studies and show his interest. When he does, he shows that he has potential and he performs very good."
Red,Obaid missed many classes after the transition to the on-line system. Unfortunately his Summative 1 assessment has had to be forwarded to an academic misconduct panel and the outcome is not known yet. I hope that Obaid will start to work hard in class and at home in order to catch up and complete the year with reasonable results. I recommend him to attend the Maths workshops and submit his homework regularly.

Red,"Huai is friendly and he is well-liked by his classmates. He makes some effort to participate in the group work by making contributions from time to time. However, when it comes to working individually, he often needs reminders to stay on task. It has been noticed that he has had some difficulty adjusting to the academic expectations of the course. He demonstrates enthusiasm to learn but needs to make more effort to actively contribute to class. Based on the poor results of the continuous assessment (scores well below 40%), Huai was referred to both the listening as well as writing workshops in Term 1. His reading, writing and listening skills require considerable improvement. It is recommended that Huai does independent study using resources on the Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to improve his chances of progression."
Red,"Your attitude in Arts is somewhat problematic. Attendance has been something of an issue for you, and you rarely contribute to class discussions - and sometimes try  to do the same with group work. You did not submit a Formative Assignment, which makes judging your progress still harder. Moreover, you did not reply to any of my requests for a tutorial over the last few weeks, so this situation is becoming more problematic. In order to progress, you really need to start working harder in Arts."
Pink,"Huai's main problem has been his commitment to learning. He is a bright young man who is however lazy and not willing to commit to studying in an English University environment. His attendance has also been an issue while he did not submit a formative. 
While I believe Huai to be a very intelligent young man, his mentality towards learning might not allow him to progress."
Pink,"I have real worries concerning Huai's progression. He is not taking studying at this level seriously and his attendance and failure to submit a formative assignment reflects this. 
I am certain that he is able to progress but he has to commit himself and take this seriously."

Red,"Selina is a quiet student who has engaged with the AES course to some extent over the duration of Term 1. Selina is encouraged to express her opinion in class more often and come to class prepared. She continues to require regular assistance with many aspects of the academic programme and has difficulty completing homework assignments on time. Therefore, establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of Selina’s goals in term 2. It is recommended that Selina does independent study using resources on Moodle, which is likely to improve her chances of progression."
Red,"Your Formative Assignment mark was not particularly strong, so you are going to have to work hard to ensure you do well in your Summative Assignment. You need to work hard generally in Arts - it is hard to tell whether you are really engaging with the classes as you are so quiet. You say a bit more in groups, but need to try and be a bit more adventurous in class discussions, especially with the transition to online learning."
Amber,"Selina is a mild-mannered and very polite student. Her language level poses a significant challenge, but aside from this she shows some grasp of how to use visual material to convey a narrative or message. For this reason I have faith that Selina could do very well in this subject indeed. I would like it very much if Selina pushed harder to get involved in class."
Pink,Jiawen is very quiet in the classes and she has failed to submit a proper formative assignment. I am worried about her progression as I do not have a clear idea of her ability.
Red,"In term 2, Selina has not engaged with the online delivery mode and the AES module as well as expected. The student is strongly encouraged to do her homework, come to class prepared and participate in pair work and group work as instructed. It has been noticed that Selina lacks motivation to study, which also shows in her academic subjects. Therefore, it is crucial for Selina to establish a consistent study plan and homework / independent study routine. Attending VOH and 1-2-1 tutorials will also be of great benefit to the student and help her catch up with her studies and improve her marks."
Amber,"We have spoken about the problems with your Arts module, particularly since we went to online learning. You have had some problems with attendance, and although your attendance has now improved, your participation is minimal. Now that we have spoken about the necessity for you participate in order to catch up and the plan for you to attend workshops so that you can improve your mark with a resit, hopefully this will mean that you focus on your Arts work afresh."
Pink,"Selina's summative 1 results were not very strong and therefore Selina should resit s1. I am disappointed that she failed to attend her feedback tutorial and missed the first of three sessions set up to help those resitting s1. Selina struggles to join in during class discussions and her main barrier is not in fact her spoken (and written) English - both of which are competent and good enough to communicate her thoughts and feelings. Selina's main barrier is her confidence. A meeting most recently left me very frustrated because she would not, or could not, reply to simple questions or engage in a simple discussion. Long stretches of silence left me flabbergasted, as Selina failed to express any thoughts whatsoever. This problem is central to Selina's challenge of studying in the UK. If she is to proceed and potentially progress, Selina needs to show a lot more evidence of her learning (use of film and media vocabulary; drawing on key concepts; proving she can read visual texts etc.)"
Red,"I have real worries over Selina's ability to pass/progress. I do believe that progression is going to be extremely difficult for her, but she might be able to pass if she shows some commitment in learning. Her English proficiency is really bad and she needs to put a tremendous amount of effort to improve it. 

With the switch to online teaching, she has not done much to help herself. She often seems to not pay attention, her video screen is constantly black and she is never able to answer questions. While I addressed these issues in a tutorial with her, she has not really showed any signs of improvement."

Pink,"Cem has found it challenging to complete any of the compulsory AES assignments in the first two weeks of term 2. Therefore, establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of his main goals. Cem should attend the virtual office hours and try to catch up on what has been covered so far. This strategy should be implemented so that, in the coming weeks, Cem is able to engage with the course more effectively. Cem should also start using AES study materials available on Moodle and work his way through the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to improve his chances of progression."
Pink,"Cem is an unusual student. He has had poor attendance at classes and when he does come to class there is clearly some issue related to his attention. However, at times he is able to make intelligent contributions to class discussion (albeit they can be poorly informed due to his lack of attention to the class). Cem has not mastered the approach to learning as a skill and is therefore at great risk of failing the course even though it may be that he has the intelligence to do so. Cem needs to address his studies seriously and that means following instructions from teachers and acting on the advice and guidance that he is receiving."
Red,"Cem - You show some knowledge and understanding in class when you attend my classes but this is very patchy and needs to improve. You have also not submitted your formative -1. Your organisation needs to improve and this is linked to your need to show greater discipline. For example, when you are in my classes you are often easily distracted. Usually, you are not an active participant in class discussions and this is a shame as I feel you have much to contribute. You are in danger of not meeting your progression requirements."
Red,Cem is very unlikely to reach progression. He did not submit his Formative Assessment 1. He has not been involved at all in class discussions and has not completed any homework.
Amber,"Cem's engagement with the AES course in term 2 has been rather inconsistent. Therefore, following his timetable, setting aside the time needed to study and complete compulsory tasks, and establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become his priority in term 3. Cem should attend the VOH and ask any questions he might have around good academic practice and avoiding plagiarism in academic writing. This combined strategy should be implemented so that, in term 3, Cem is able to engage with the course more effectively and, by doing so, increase his chance to progress to University."
Pink,"Cem remains an unusual student. Whilst it seems that he has the capability to succeed on the course his attendance and focus on class remains poor. Having said that his summative result was comparatively good so he continues to have a chance of completing the course successfully. My advice remains that he should attend his classes consistently and undertake the tasks that he is given, if he does this there is a chance that he can complete the course overall."
Pink,"Cem - You show some knowledge and understanding in class when you attend, but I would ask that concentrate more when you do attend. Your summative-1 score is 51%. You need to be more organised in terms of planning and preparing for your assignments and improve your discipline. For example, when you are in my classes you are often easily distracted. You need to take notes regularly in class and engage with what has been uploaded to Moodle. I feel you have much to contribute but you need to work harder. You are in danger of not meeting your progression requirements."
Pink,"Following the submission for the Summative Assessment 1, Cem is unlikely to meet the progression requirements. His essay mirrors his overall lack of engagement with the subject. Moreover, he missed many classes and did not complete any homework so far, and I am not confident that he is able to catch up. As a matter of urgency, I recommend that he starts attending the classes, engages with the topics discussed, and completes his homework every week."

Amber,"Jin has demonstrated some degree of engagement with the AES course over the past few weeks. He has managed to attend most classes and submitted several compulsory tasks, which means that he was able to receive some valuable feedback and suggestions how to improve the quality of his academic work. Jin should act on the feedback he received and make necessary improvements. Going forward, Jin should use the materials for independent study available on Moodle in order to further improve his chances of progression."
Red,"Jin has made a very disappointing start to the year. He does not appear to understand the lectures in class and does not contribute to class discussions. Further to this, when he is asked a direct question he is often unable to answer indicating that he is not keeping up with the course material. Understandably, he also has some difficulty concentrating in class. Jin's formative 1 result was very poor and I am very concerned that Jin may not be able to successfully complete the course. He now needs to focus on dramatically improving his english language skills."
Amber,"Jin Long has a very good attendance in the Maths class. He has a good understanding of maths and he achieved a good grade in his formative assessment. Jin Long does needs improve his language skills and participate more in the class. Thus, he can contribute in the class discussions and improve his maths skills as well."
Amber,"Jiang(Brain) - You show some interest in the class and this has shows a little in your formative -1 score (52%). You need to participate more in group discussion and work on your writing skills; this is because, while your performance is fair you need to stretch yourself further. You need to work harder too in order to reach your progression requirement, To do this please engage in independent reading from sources such as Moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Pink,"Jinlong's attendance and participation in the AES course in term 2 have been satisfactory. The student attended his CW1 tutorial but needs to better engage with his coursework in order to achieve a good mark. Jinlong should take every opportunity to ask questions regarding good academic practice at University and act on the feedback he has received so far. Going forward, Jinlong should attend the VOH in order to speak to the AES tutors not only about his AES assignments but also about anything he finds challenging in his academic work."
Pink,"Jin Long remains in a difficult situation. He has improved his english during the first term, but this has not improved enough. As a result he finds it difficult to follow the class discussions and to answer questions when asked. 
His summative 1 assignment was disappointing, but it is of greater concern that he has not asked for a tutorial to get feedback in order to prepare for the resit. If he is to succeed Jin Long cannot be a passive student, he must grasp the opportunity for learning with both hands and apply his energies to his studies."
Pink,These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Jin Long missed a few classes and his test result of 40% was very disappointing. He needs to start working hard in order to pass the S1 resit and prepare for S2 assessment. I recommend his to attend the classes and Maths workshop regularly and submit the homework for feedback.
Pink,"Jiang - You show some interest in the class, and this has shown a little in your summative  -1 score 42%. You need to improve your concentration level participate more in group discussion, make considerable notes and work on your writing skills, while your performance is just fair you need to stretch yourself further to reach your progression requirement, To do this please engage in independent reading from sources such as Moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook."

Red,"Wu is a friendly student who gets along well with his peers. He often needs tutor’s prompts, encouragement and reminders to begin and complete a given task. Based on the poor results of the continuous in-class assessment (all scores below 40%), Wu was referred to the listening workshops in Term 1. His listening, writing and speaking skills require further improvement. For this reason, he should study independently using resources available on Moodle, which is likely to improve his chances of progression."
Red,"Chuanjin is polite and attentive in class, but he is often unable to follow class discussions due to his lack of skill in english. This lack of skill in understanding english has meant that his formative 1 result was very poor. If his language skills do not improve it will be very difficult for Chuanjin to succeed on the course and so he must now apply himself to his language skills at every opportunity."
Pink,"Wu - Your attendance is good, you are obedient in class but you need to make a significant effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussion. Your score for formative is 48% It clearly shows you need to improve, you do demonstrate some understanding of the subject, but seem to have difficulty in applying in assessments. You need to work hard to reach progression requirement, your aim should be to improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Amber,"I believe Mr. Wu will be able to progress if he improves his English communication skills. He seems to be able to understand everything we discuss in class but he has issues with verbalising his thoughts. While I believe he will have no issues with getting a progression mark for Psychology, he needs to improve his English in order to progress from AES."
Pink,"In term 2, Wu has engaged with the online delivery mode and the AES module to some extent. The student is strongly encouraged to continue working hard on improving his academic skills, complete his homework, come to class prepared and participate in pair work and group work as instructed. It has been noticed that Wu has been very quiet in his AES classes, which is the same as in his academic subjects. Therefore, it is crucial for Wu to establish a consistent study plan and homework / independent study routine. Attending VOH and 1-2-1 tutorials will also be of great benefit to the student and help him ensure understanding of the assessments, and consequently, improve his marks."
Red,Chuanjin remains in a difficult situation. He has one major impediment to his success on the course and this is his skill in english language. His summative 1 result was very poor and this is primarily because of his poor language skills. Unless he can dramatically improve his capability in this area then I am not optimistic about his possibility of passing the course.
Amber,"Wu - Your attendance is good, you are obedient in class but you need to make a significant effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussion. Your score for summative is 49% It clearly shows you need to improve,  you do demonstrate some understanding of the subject, but seem to have difficulty in applying in assessments.  To improve your aim should be to make considerable notes and by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you attain good progression score."
Pink,"I do have some concerns regarding Wu's ability to progress. While I am certain he will pass, he has had difficulties in his English expression, both speaking and writing. He is unable to articulate his thoughts in English and even if he manages to get a progress in academic subjects, I do not see him doing the same for AES. He needs to improve his speaking especially. I would recommend that he engages with all the support the AES can offer."

Red,"Zeeshan has found it challenging to engage with the course or complete any of the compulsory AES tasks in the first two weeks of term 2. Therefore, establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of his main goals. Zeeshan should attend the virtual office hours and try to catch up on what has been covered so far. It is recommended that Zeeshan familiarises himself with the online learning mode and starts using study materials available on Moodle, both of which are likely to improve his chances of progression."
Amber,"Zeeshan is a pleasant and positive student, but he is currently not taking his studies seriously enough. He is often late or missing from class and when he is in class he is often distracted. When he does pay attention he is able to engage well with class discussions and shows signs of good understanding, but due to his general lack of commitment he will find it difficult to succeed on the course. If Zeeshan can apply himself with energy to the course I am very optimistic about his chances of success."
Red,Zeeshan has shown good attendance.  He puts insufficient effort into his work.  He does not concentrate and distracts the class. When he participates he shows that he is capable of achieving a good result in maths. He did not attend the maths formative assessment. Zeeshan should work harder and engage with his homework in order to progress and enter in the university.
Pink,"Zeeshan - You show some interest in the class, your score for formative -1 is 48%. You are putting in some of the efforts in your work, at times engaged in class. You need to participate more in group discussion and enhance your skills, which will help you in your writing skill, your performance is fair but needs to stretch yourself further. You need to work hard to reach progression requirement, To do this please engage in independent reading from sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Pink,"Initially, Zeeshan's engagement with the AES course was unsatisfactory. He has improved to some extent in the past couple of weeks; however, it is crucial that he fully engages with his AES course and studies hard in order to pass his summative assessments. The student should attend the VOH, ask his AES tutors any questions he might have regarding good academic practice at University and work hard to catch up with the course. In term 3, it is hoped that Zeeshan will take his studies at the RHISC more seriously, which is essential for his progression."
Pink,"Zeeshan has unfortunately continued the pattern of his approach to his studies from term 1. Whilst Zeeshan has some talent he is not taking advantage of the opportunity to use this talent and he continues to lack energy and application to his studies. There have been some discussions with him about what he specifically needs to do to improve his performance, but so far he has not responded to these discussions. An important indicator of this lack of engagement is that he has not submitted the first assessed work which will contribute to his overall marks on the course."
Red,"Zeeshan missed all the classes after the transition to on-line teaching. He did not submit his S1 coursework. Zeeshan was offered a few extra tutorials, but he did not reply to the invitation. He also did not attend the Maths workshop. Zeeshan should resume his studies immediately to have a chance to progress to the university degree."
Pink,"Zeeshan - You show some interest in the class, You are putting in some of the efforts in your work it is seen in your summative -1 score which is 58%.  Your performance is fair but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this you need to improve your attendance. You need to participate more in group discussion and enhance your skills consider making notes which will help in your writing skill. Please engage in independent reading from sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."

Pink,"Go is a dedicated student with satisfactory classroom performance and homework completion. His listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below 40% in his listening and writing assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, being more active in class, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. He may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Amber,"Your assignment mark was good - well done. It gives you a very solid foundation for your summative assignment, so you should be pleased. However, you are exceptionally quiet in class, even in group work, which makes it very hard to tell whether you understand or not. Ultimately, you need to start participating in class. This may seem overwhelming at first, but it will really help you improve in the long run. This is the main thing for you to focus on in the New Year."
Pink,"Go is a mild-mannered and very polite student. His language level poses a significant challenge, but beyond this he also needs to work on understanding how to use visual material to convey a narrative or message. I feel strongly, that if Go focuses his mind on what he needs to do, and revises class notes and works independently and with his classmates, he will show improvement and potentially gain much higher results that he has in his formative 1 assessment."
Amber,"Go's level of attendance has been excellent. 

His participation in class can improve if he gains more confidence. He started talking more during the workshops.

He seems to be putting effort in studying Sociology and this is reflected also with his assessment.

The assessment was good and he is almost achieving progression mark. He can only improve on this."
Pink,"Go is a hard-working and conscientious student. He listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Go has barely achieved 60% in CW1 and he still needs to work harder to improve his writing, listening and speaking skills. Attending virtual office hours and doing additional independent learning tasks on Moodle are highly recommended to improve chances of progression."
Pink,"Your Summative 1 was a good attempt, but your Formative 2 shows that you have a bit of a way to go. However, you are a conscientious student, so you should be able to make progress as long as you are on the right path. You need to make sure that you read primary texts carefully and engage with secondary literature. You should also engage more in class and group discussions more as you remain exceptionally quiet even two terms into the year. This needs to change for your academic development."
Red,"While Go is a lovely student, his language level has posed a significant barrier to his learning. His poor performance in his summative 1 has put him at a great disadvantage and I am concerned that without drastic efforts on his part he will not be able to progress on to his chosen degree. My advice would be for Go to study carefully the learning outcomes for summative 2 and ensure that he demonstrates his learning clearly. I also suggest that he takes a more proactive approach and submits drafts of his work to me for advice and guidance."
Pink,"Go has put effort in improving this year but his level of confidence and level of English has not allowed him to improve enough to attain a progression mark. 
I am afraid it will be very difficult for Go to attain a progression mark for RH but I believe he will be attaining a pass grade and might be able to attend a different English University."

Pink,Hamza shows determination to learn but needs to make more effort to actively contribute to class discussions. He needs to attend the writing workshops in term 2 so that he can improve his writing skills. It is important that he engages in independent study over the winter break using sources available to him on Moodle and in his AES textbook.
Pink,46% formative 1 result.  Hamza is capable of a better result with a little more dedication to independent study and a willingness to complete well presented work in class.  Hamza will ask for help in class but must attend workshops for extra support in Decision Maths.
Amber,Hamza is a student with a good background in Physics. His attendance is very good. He participates in the class and he shows interest. However he needs to concentrate more and work harder. His report needs improvement and more work. He has potential for a very good result if he puts more effort.
Amber,Hamza has done great progress in Maths since he joined the ISC. He has shown interest and is working hard. His attendance is very good. His grade is very good. He can achieve higher even results in the summative exams with some more effort and participation. As he wants 70% for Maths I give him an amber rating.
Pink,"Hamza shows determination to learn new skills but he needs to make more effort to improve his weaker skills, namely speaking and writing. It is obvious that he has improved his skills since the beginning of the term; however, his weaker skills require further improvement. It is important that he engages in independent study using resources available to him on Moodle and in his AES textbooks for term 1 and term 2."
Pink,"Hamza has not engaged fully with his studies or with his activities in class.  His attendance was also beginning to be a problem in term 2.  Although workshops were in place to support Hamza, he has not taken avantage of these.  Hamza must work hard in term 3 to catch up with his studies, complete the new assessments and ensure sure he has full attendance in order to work towards a successful outcome."
Pink,"Hamza did not show good attendance during this term. He does not focus in the class and he does not engage with this homework. His has shown a good knowledge of the topics when he participates, he has potential and he does not need hard work to achieve a good mark. For physics, his grade is the physics lab report is good, although he is one of the students in the class that could achieve more. His formative assessment was only 40 %.
 Hamza should be more active and change his attitude, become more interested, in order to achieve his goal to pass to the university."
Pink,"Hamza did not have good attendance during this term. Although he has a good background in Maths and he has potential, Hamza do not participate in the class and he does not engage with his homework. Hamza should work hard and start again the mandatory workshops or tutorials with his tutor to ensure that he is  on track and he will achieve the 70% mark for progression."

Pink,"Zezhang shows determination to learn  but he needs to make more effort to actively contribute to class discussions. He needs to attend writing and listening workshops in term 2 so that he can improve his writing and listening skills. It is important that he engages in independent study over the winter break using sources available to him on Moodle and in his AES textbook. In addition to this, in order to improve his seminar discussion skills, he should go through the functional language and section, which was covered  in Term 1 AES textbook."
Green,92% formative 1 result.  Zezheng has an excellent command of this topic and marks lost were mainly language based questions.  Zezheng must ensure he understands the meaning of this specialist language and can recall the words.
Green,Zezheng  is a very bright student. His attendance is good and his skills are excellent. Zezheng is advised to participate more and be a more active student.
Green,Zezheng is an excellent student. He has excellent skills in maths. He is advised to participate more and be a more active student in the class.
Pink,"Zezhang shows determination to learn but he needs to make more effort to improve his weaker skills, namely speaking, and writing. He has improved some of his skills since the beginning of the term but his weaker skills still require further improvement. It is important that he engages in independent study and to use the resources available to him on Moodle and in the AES Term 1 & 2 textbooks. He can also benefit from doing exam pracrtices, which can be found on Moodle."
Green,Zezheng does not have much to say in class but is fully engaged in the problem solving and this is reflected in the excellent result in both formative assessments.  The online classes to come will undoubtedly require more conversation and this practise will be needed for the poster presentation.
Green,"Zezheng is a bright student. His attendance is great, he participates in the class and he has shown his good understanding in his great results in his assessments. The only advice for Zezheng is to be more active in the class in order to increase his fluency and confidence with English."
Green,"Zezheng has a great attendance, he performs excellent in Maths and he is an example of student. The only advise for him is to improve his communication skills and participate more in the class as this is important skill to have as a student."

Amber,"Hui has done well in the first two weeks of term 2 by showing continuous engagement with the course and submitting most of the compulsory AES tasks. This means that he has already received some valuable feedback. It is hoped that the tutor's comments will help Hui achieve good marks for his work. Throughout the second term, Hui is encouraged to work on his communication skills and his level of self-confidence. He is also encouraged to express his opinions more often during class discussions. In the coming weeks, Hui should dedicate some time to researching his CW1 assignment topic in order to give himself a chance for a high mark."
Pink,"Hui takes his studies seriously and does try to concentrate in class, however his english language skills remain the biggest impediment to his chances of success. His formative 1 result was reasonable, but not at a high enough standard to achieve progression and I am concerned that this pattern will continue if he cannot radically improve his english language skills. Whilst he is in the UK he should take the opportunity of immersing himself in english language material to achieve an improvement in his language skill."
Pink,"Hui has a good attendance in the Maths class. He does not participate in the class, he is quiet and he does not have a good understanding in maths. The language barrier makes the progress of Hui difficult. Hui has to improve his language skills, participate more in the class , engage with his homework and study harder. Hui is advised to attend compulsory workshops or tutorials with his tutor."
Amber,"HU - You showing some interest in the class, be more active in class you need to participate in group discussions, your score for formative -1 is 60%. Your performance is good but needs to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle, other sources outlined in the lesson plan and the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Amber,"Hui's continuous engagement with the AES course has been noted. The student attended his CW1 tutorial and showed a positive attitude towards the AES module and his assignments. It is hoped that the AES tutor's constructive feedback will help Hui achieve good marks for his coursework. Hui should start working on improving his presentation skills so that he can achieve a good mark for his CW2 summative presentation. The student should also put some time aside to prepare for his CW3 extended researched essay which needs to be submitted in term 3. To build on his confidence with online exams, Hui should make the most of the mock exams available to students on the WISEflow platform."
Red,"Hui appears to be a committed student, but his standard of english remains his biggest obstacle to succeeding in his studies. During classes he is unable to answer basic questions because it appears that he finds it hard to understand these questions. He then lacks the skill to put together a suitable answer. This means that his learning is severely impeded. 
His summative 1 result was poor and I am not optimistic that this trend will change going forward unless he makes a dramatic change in his approach."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Hui attends the class regularly, but does not participate much in discussion. He got a very impressive result of 84% in his S1 coursework. I hope he will continue to work to the same standard and progress with a very good results."
Amber,"HU - You showing some interest in the class, be more active in class you need to participate in group discussions, your score for summative -1 is 62%. Your performance is good but needs to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. To do this, please make a considerable amount of notes, independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle, other sources outlined in the lesson plan, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly"

Pink,"Overall Sofiya possesses a reasonable level of English, particularly her speaking. However, she needs to show greater commitment and engagement to her AES module because she has not submitted/ completed any essays this term. This has meant she has not received feedback on her writing. She has missed some essential input to academic writing and valuable exam practice in the last 2 weeks of term. I hope to see an improved level of engagement in term 2. The area that she needs to focus on are her academic writing skills, and she can seek further support from drop-in clinics and writing workshops."
Amber,Sofiya is a very good student. She is engaged and attentive in class and although she does not voluntarily participate in class discussions she is able to answer questions when asked directly. She has a good understanding of key concepts and this will help her going forward. I believe that Sofiya has a very good chance of succeeding on the course as long as she maintains this high level of motivation and energy.
Pink,"You show some fair knowledge of understanding in your assessment. Your score is 57%, which is satisfactory but not high enough for you to meet your academic requirements. You need to actively participate in class discussions, should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You need to consistently make extra efforts, make a considerable amount of notes in class, revise material posted on Moodle so that you can improve your score. In particular, you need to improve your language skills."
Pink,"I have to admit that I was disappointed with Sofiya. She started the year with lots of potential but her levels of effort have come down since.

Her attendance has been generally very good although it became a bit patchy of late.

She was much keener to participate initially during the year but now she rarely contributes in the class.

Her result was disappointing to see as I expected much more from her."
Amber,"Sofiya's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have been overall satisfactory. Her term 1 exam results have highlighted that her writing skills are much weaker than her other skills. This is a skill that she has struggled with since starting the IFY and one where she needs to remain committed to improving and not feel discouraged in the process. Her CW1 grade was disappointing as she is capable of achieving a higher grade had she acted upon the feedback given to her during draft 1. For Term 3 I hope that she will show a better commitment to CW2 and CW3 because I believe that by focusing and being committed and seeking help when needed with exams and assignments, she will succeed on the IFY."
Amber,Sofiya is a good student who is motivated and committed in class. Her resit assessment was of a good standard and this is a good indicator of her overall performance on the course. Sofiya must remain focussed on her studies and maintain her organisation so that she can complete the course successfully.
Amber,"Sofiya - YouYou show some understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  54%our results in assessments have been fair so far. Improve your concentration level. You should be more focused work hard to your potential use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle"
Green,"I am very pleased to report that Sofiya picked up during term 2 and she has managed to deliver to her initial promise. She improved on her attendance and participation, and this was reflected also in her S1 result. I have no worries she will be able to progress given she continues with the same determination and commitment."

Amber,"Haotian demonstrates good English language skills and contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. He listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as a group. He is also fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. His writing and listening skills, however, need further development. Attending writing and listening workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. He is also advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard."
Pink,Haotian is a good student and engages well in class. If he is asked questions he will give thoughtful and well reasoned answers. His first assignment was over word count so with the penalty his mark was quite disappointing. If Haotian takes the feedback I am very hopeful that he will develop into a successful student on the course.
Pink,"You have some fair knowledge of the topics that have been covered in class, you demonstrate some understanding of the subject, you at times actively participate in class. You need to be consistent and use your potential to the maximum and make considerable effort to write notes in class. You have submitted your submission sheet very late, please be organised with time and have a right idea about your assessment read the instruction given in moodle, in turnitin. Your score is 41% in formative, lost 10% marks due to late submission. Please do not repeat it."
Amber,"Haotian's formative assessment showed a good understanding of political economy. However, he needs to allocate more time for independent study and to focus more closely on global politics. It would be advisable to complete the homework regularly and to try to engage more with the issues we study from a political science point of view."
Pink,"Haotian demonstrates good speaking skills and contributes, when present, to all class discussions. Haotian has achieved well above 50% in overall grades, which is slightly lower than the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He is particularly struggling with his academic writing skills and therefore needs to work harder to improve on them. Attending virtual office hours and doing extra writing tasks in his AES book and on Moodle are recommended to improve his chances of progression."
Pink,"Although Haotian showed some promise during term 1 he has now lost focus and energy on the course. His attendance has got worse and his engagement with work on the course has reduced. This is concerning as in order to succeed Haotian needed to increase his focus, not reduce it. His skill in english has been improving, but he must address this lack of focus if he is to succeed."
Amber,"Haotain - While you have attended most of my classes this term, you don't show much initiative when it comes to answering or participating in our group discussions. You need to improve your communication skills and pushing hard to demonstrate your subject knowledge. Despite this however, I was pleased to see your summative -1 results which was 61%. If you could match this with your participation in class, I believe this would help you refine and improve your score even further."
Amber,"Haotian's essay for the Summative Assessment 1 shows great progress. He improved knowledge and understanding of politics, as well as his academic writing skills. As the last two assessments are oral ones, I recommend that in the last term he not only allocates time for independent study and to complete his homework, but he also devotes time to improve his oral English proficiency."

He listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. He is also fully engaged in class and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. His writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops and doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to him on Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression. He is also advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard."
Amber,"Yifan is a very good student. He is always engaged and attentive in class. However, he does not participate in class discussions easily and I think that this would be help his development. His written work is very good and shows good understanding and this is reflected in the very good marks in his first assignment. I expect Yifan to do very well on the course."
Pink,"You have a fair knowledge of the topics that have been covered in class. You demonstrate some understanding of the subject. You need to actively participate in class discussion. Your score is 53%, which shows you have potential, but you need to use your potential to the maximum. You should aim to make more notes in class and for all writing assignments make a flow chart to organise your thoughts. Revise material posted on Moodle and with all these steps in place, you can improve your score."
Amber,"Level of attendance is very good. 

Although his participation in class is satisfactory, the more he practises and applies the skills he learns in class the more progress he will make. 

He puts a reasonable level of effort into his work but can build a stronger foundation for his future studies.

He generally demonstrates a good understanding.

His results in assessments have been satisfactory so far but he needs to improve to ensure progression."
Green,"I am very pleased with the attitude of and progress being made in AES course by Yifan. He is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Yifan has achieved above 70% in overall grades, which is well above the English language requirement for his chosen degree, which is an excellent result for this term. I am sure he will continue to make progress with his good learning attitudes. Last but not least, Yifan should ensure to complete homework after class."
Green,"Yifan is a very good student who has developed his confidence very well during the first 2 terms. His level of contribution to the group is very good. He concentrates well in class, takes notes and is able to contribute to class discussions very well. His summative 1 was indicative of this hard work and this has the potential to improve has he grows his skill and confidence."
Amber,"Bai Yifan -  You have attended most of my classes this term and you are an active participant most of the time in class discussions. At times you get distracted in the class, you are putting in considerable effort in your work. Your summative -1 score is 64% and shows a good level of knowledge and understanding, although there is of course room for improvement. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,Yifan did very good in his Summative 1 and I have no worries that he will be able to attain the grade required for him to progress.

Amber,"Hamza is engaged and participates well in class and has built a good rapport with his fellow classmates. He possesses strong English skills, but has struggled to apply the academic writing skills taught in class. He needs to pay closer attention to his academic style of writing, and if he has questions, he should seek the help that is necessary to help him improve his overall performance. One further aspect that he could develop is the ability to evaluate credible sources to support points in discussion."
Amber,Hamza is a pleasant and interested student.It is unfortunate that he did not complete the first assignment so it is difficult to get a full view of his progress to date. Hamza does participate in class and appears to have a good understanding of key concepts so I remain optimistic about his future progress. Hamza needs to focus on his studies and plan his time more effectively to make the most of the opportunity.
Pink,"You demonstrate some command of the subject Your score is 48%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class. Usually, an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions. You need to focus a little more in class. you need to make notes in class, please improve your concentration level in class, you can be easily distracted as you come with prior knowledge of the subject, your performance can be strong, but need to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,"Hamza seems like a very smart young man but needs to take studying a bit more seriously. 

He can improve his participation in class and his effort in terms of studying Sociology. 

I do not have data in relation to his assessment as he did not submit an assignment."
Amber,"Hamza's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have been overall satisfactory, which shows that there is room for improvement. He needs to work on his writing and listening skills; and with more careful preparation and planning he is capable of achieving a higher score. His CW1 was particularly disappointing; and I believe this is owing to a lack of effort. With more preparation and commitment to his CW1 assignment he would have achieved a very different outcome. I hope that for Term 3 he will be more focused and committed and whilst seeking help with his studies to act upon the feedback. I believe he will succeed on the IFY as long as he puts the effort in."
Amber,"Hamza remains a very pleasant and polite student. He has also increased his energy and application since the first term. However, Hamza still finds it difficult to concentrate in class, in spite of his good language skills. He is not certain of passing the course (as shown by his summative 1 results) so he must become more organised and apply himself more consistently to his studies if he is to succeed."
Pink,"Hamza -You show some understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  52% Your results in assessments have been fair so far. Improve your concentration level. You should be more focused work hard to your potential use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle"
Green,Hamza had a not so good S1 but his resit was quite good (in the range of 65). He needs to continue with the same commitment in order to attain a progression mark.  If he shows some further determination he will have no problems at all with progressing.

Pink,"Defne demonstrates good speaking skills and makes frequent contributions to class discussions. She usually investigates and obtains information independently and does well in terms of sharing her findings in front of the class. However, her listening skills need further development, as she has scored barely above 40% in all her listening assessments to date. What is more, Defne should continue working on her writing skills and take on board the feedback she has received so far. It is recommended that Defne does independent study over her winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to help her achieve her academic study goals."
Amber,"Defne has had a positive result from her first assignment. However, I still have some concerns about her success on the course. She is often lacking in focus and concentration in class. When asked specific questions she is quite often unable to answer or her answers show basic misunderstanding about the concepts. It is possible that her language skills are the cause of this, but Defne should increase her energy in order to ensure success this year."
Pink,"You show some fair knowledge of understanding in your assessment. Your score is 44%, which is satisfactory but not high enough for you to meet your academic requirements. You need to actively participate in class discussions, should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You need to consistently make extra efforts, make a considerable amount of notes in class, revise material posted on Moodle so that you can improve your score. In particular, you need to improve your English language skills."
Pink,"Defne needs to work hard to achieve progression. I recommend to pay more attention to what is discussed in class and devote more time for independent study, I also advise to focus on improving academic writing and the research skills."
Pink,"Defne works well on her own but often needs reminders and encouragement to begin tasks and remain focused in class. She is generally a considerate student who, however, continues to have some difficulty completing homework assignments on time. Defne is encouraged to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude. Establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of Defne’s main goals this term. Her writing skills require considerable improvement. Therefore, it is recommended that she does independent study using resources available on the Moodle, completes mock exams as set by her tutor and submits all the compulsory AES tasks on the Moodle every week. Defne has made some progress in terms of her reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where she was awarded a mark of 64%. If she continues to work on her academic skills development in term 3, she should increase her chance of progression to her chosen UG course at Royal Holloway."
Amber,"Defne's work has been improving, but there remain some challenges to her success on the course. She must not only work on her english skills, she must also develop improved study skills to increase her understanding of key concepts on the course. Without organised study she will increasingly find the work more challenging and therefore risk not completing the course successfully. She now needs to concentrate on advice from her teachers and follow this with energy."
Pink,"Defne -  Your attendance is satisfactory, you show some understanding in class, You need to concentrate more in class you usually relatively quiet although. You should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You should be more focused on your aims and work harder to achieve them. Your summative-1  score is  56% Your results in assessments have been satisfactory so far.  Use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle."
Amber,"Defne's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 shows improvement and increased confidence. Unfortunately, the correct use of academic sources remains a problem and I recommend that she focuses on addressing this. She also needs to dedicate more time to independent study to gain depth of knowledge and improve her ability to engage critically with political science topics. I recommend that she does her homework regularly and involves herself more often in class discussions."

I recommend Defne to resit Summative Assessment 2 and insist that she has her essays reviewed by the AES team. Her grade was significantly lowered by the quality of written communication."

Amber,"Kamil is a conscientious student and possesses strong English skills, and this has been reflected in his class performance. He has a good rapport with his classmates and this, thus, fosters a good learning environment. He has also demonstrated a critical approach to tasks in class and has a good grasp of the academic skills required for his academic studies. His formative results have mostly been pleasing, but I feel that he has the potential to improve upon them with more practice."
Amber,"Kamil is a very good student. He is fully engaged in class, he participates fully in class discussions and readily answers questions. At times he does not have a full grasp of the concepts, however as long as he continues to work with the energy and motivation that he has shown so far then I am very optimistic for his success this year. His first assignment was a little disappointing, but I am sure that he will listen to the feedback and perform better for the second one."
Pink,"You have some fair knowledge of the topics that have been covered in class, you demonstrate some understanding of the subject, You actively participate in class. Need to use your potential to the maximum, and make considerable effort to write notes in class. You have submitted your assignment very late, Your score is 46% which is way behind your potential, please be organised with time and have the right idea about your assessment read the instruction given in moodle and Turnitin."
Amber,"His level of attendance is good. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement here.

His participation is very good in class.

He puts a very good level of effort into his work.

He is making very good progress. He has a very good level of understanding and knowledge.

His results in assessments have been satisfactory so far. To ensure progression, he should take it more seriously and show more determination."
Amber,"Kamil's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have yielded mixed, but overall positive, results. Kamil has strong speaking and listening skills, but these are not always fully reflected in his results and so with more careful preparation he is capable of achieving a higher score. Reading and writing are skills that need to be improved upon in order to meet progression. However, during Term 2, there has been a noticeable improvement which is very promising. I believe that by continuing to be focused and committed in Term 3 and seeking help when needed with exams and assignments I am confident that he will succeed on the IFY."
Green,Kamil continues to make good progress. He is a very motivated and committed student and he shows this by participating very positively in class. He asks intelligent questions and is always open to answering questions to the best of his ability. His assessment performance was good and if this continues I expect him to be very successful on the course overall.
Amber,"Kamil -  You have attended most of my classes this term and you are an active participant most of the time in class discussions. At times you get distracted in the class, you are putting in considerable effort in your work. Your summative -1 score is 71% and shows a very good level of knowledge and understanding, although there is of course room for improvement. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Amber,"Kamil has had issues with his attendance and this continued up until prior to Spring break. 
His Summative assignment was very good; nevertheless, the problems with attendance did not allow Kamil to improve on his knowledge and move towards a better grade. His F2 result speak to these issues that he has had."

Amber,"In the first instance, Shangyi needs to show greater commitment and engagement to his AES module because his class performance so far does not reflect the essential academic skills that have been covered in class and missed his reading and writing exam. Shangyi has good level of English and I believe that by showing more commitment he will do well on the IFY. The areas that he needs to focus on are his academic writing skills, and he can seek further support from drop-in clinics."
Pink,"Shangyi is a good student who listens carefully in class. He is very quiet and does not participate in class discussions. His standard of english is generally low and this makes it more difficult for him to engage with the material. However, his first assignment was encouraging and if he continues to improve and works with motivation then he has a good chance of succeeding this year."
Green,"94% formative 1 result.  Shangyi has performed well in this assessment and in class.  Whilst this unit has not proved difficult, Shangyi should be working through some of the more challenging concepts in the Core Maths workbook and now be preparing for the statistics unit starting in the next term."
Pink,"You demonstrate some understanding of the subject Your score is 39%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class. Usually, you not active participant in class discussions Need to focus a little more in class. You need to make notes in class, please improve your concentration level in class, your performance can be better your aim should be to improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward"
Green,"Shangyi's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have yielded mixed results. He should work on improving his speaking skills and through better preparation and practice he will be able to achieve a good score. His CW1 assignment result was pleasing, scoring 70%, so well done. It has not always been easy to monitor Shangyi's performance and since he missed his formative reading and writing exam in Term 1 it has made it more difficult, so I hope that in Term 3 he will be better focused and make sure that he completes on-line tasks and ask questions regarding his English studies."
Amber,"Shangyi continues to find it difficult to engage in class discussions. In the first term he seemed to concentrate well in class, but it seems that his focus has reduced a little in term 2. Having said that, his most recent assessment showed some signs of improvement, however this is still not at the standard required for progression so he must now increase his energy towards his studies. His english is also not developing as fast as it could and this should be a focus area for him."
Green,Summative 1 result 99%.  Shangyi demonstrates a consistently high level of achievement and engagement in problem solving.  He is a quiet student but supportive of his peers.  Well done Shangyi and I look forward to reading your next assessment.
Amber,"Shangyi -  You show some understanding in class, you usually relatively quiet in class although. You should be less hesitant in sharing your ideas with the rest of the group. You should be more focused on your aims and work harder to achieve them. Your summative-1 resit score is  58% Your results in assessments have been satisfactory so far.  Use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle"

Amber,"Muhammad is engaged and participates in class tasks. He has shown a good general understanding of the academic skills that are required and he has tried to implement them into his classwork and helps others in their learning. One aspect he needs to pay closer attention to his academic style of writing, and if he has questions, then he should seek the help that is necessary to help him improve his overall performance."
Pink,"Your assignment mark was not particularly strong, showing that there is plenty of work for you to do in the new term. You should aim to build on the feedback given there in order to do better in your summative. However, you also need to focus on your attitude in class. You are very quiet and quite passive in class - in order to improve, this needs to change. You need to engage more actively, by taking a more active role in class discussions and group work so that your learning has a chance to develop."
Amber,"Daud showed a lot of interest in the course in the beginning. His comments were very welcome and he raised a lot of valuable points. I recommend to allocate more time to independent study on weekly basis, and most importantly to complete the homework regularly. Hard work and a lot of independent study is needed to achieve progression."
Amber,"Daud's attendance levels have been affected by the Friday prayers he is attending. This is an issue that I believe has been resolved with the intervention of Syed.

His participation in class is good but can improve even more. 

While his effort has been adequate, I believe he can do better and show a bit more determination towards studying Sociology. 

His assessment was good but he can improve a lot on it if he shows a bit more determination and effort."
Amber,"Muhammad's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have been overall positive. His term 1 exam results have highlighted that his reading and writing are slightly weaker than his speaking and listening. However, by dedicating more time to practising these skills he will see improved results. His CW1 grade although average, could have been higher had he better focused on it. For Term 3 I hope that he will show a better commitment to CW2 and CW3 because I believe that by focusing and being committed and seeking help when needed with exams and assignments, I am confident that he will succeed on the IFY."
Pink,"Although your Summative 1 was ultimately relatively successful, you did not submit a Formative Assignment. I have not yet seen the quality of your new work so it is hard for me to comment on your work. However, you have freely admitted that you are not fully engaged in the Arts course and for you to be as successful as you need for progression this needs to change. You need to start taking part in class, taking responsibility for your own learning, and engaging with the texts more fully."
Green,"Daud's essay for the Summative Assessment 1 has shows an impressive progress in terms of knowledge and understanding of politics. As we are moving online in the last term, I recommend that he allocates enough time for independent study and to complete the homework."
Amber,"Daud is a very promising young man who is not doing justice to himself. He has all the capacities and capabilities to progress and do good at University level but he is not putting adequate work in order to do that. He needs to show more commitment and determination.
His S1 was good (59) but he could have done better. His S1 resit was unfortunately worse than the s1 (58).
Despite these, I believe that he will be able to progress if he shows adequate commitment and determination."

Amber,"Zenan demonstrates good English language skills and contributes actively to all class discussions. She listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. She is also fully focused on the content and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Her writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Pink,"Zenan is a good student who is attentive in class. She does not participate in class discussions and is often unable to answer questions when asked directly. Her first assignment result was disappointing as she seems to understand concepts in class. Zenan needs to do two things to succeed going forward a) work on her skill in english to help her understand and participate in class, and b) take the feedback on board from her assignment."
Green,Zenan is an excellent student with a great attendance record. She works hard and demonstrates in the class the solutions of the homework. Her results in the exam has been excellent. The advice that is give to her is to participate more in the class. She is very quite.
Amber,"You have some fair knowledge of the topics that have been covered in class, you demonstrate some understanding of the subject, you need to actively participate in the class discussion. Your score is 61%, need to use your potential to the maximum, considerable amount of notes is made by you in class, please put that into good use, while writing assignment make a flow chart with the notes written by you, revise material posted in Moodle, you can progress your score further."
Amber,"Zenan demonstrates good reading, speaking and listening skills and contributes to all class discussions. She has handed all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Zenan has achieved above 60% in overall grades, which is above the overall English language requirement for her chosen degree. However, she still needs to work hard to improve her academic writing skills. Attending virtual office hours and doing extra writing tasks on Moodle are recommended to improve his chances of progression."
Amber,"Zenan continues to be a good student. Not only did she take on board the feedback from her formative 1 she put in some very good work on her formative 2. Her most recent assessment was good and shows some very good progress. However, I do have some concerns remaining about her capability in english and she should continue to address this if she intends to succeed in the long term on her studies."
Green,Zenan is an excellent student. Her attendance is very good. Her participation in the class is poor although her understanding in Maths is excellent. She has a good background in Maths and she is able to solve all the questions during the class. Zenan should continue to work hard and she will ensure progression.
Amber,"Zenan - You are a pleasure to teach, you are active in class and do participate in the class decisions. Your summative-1 score is 73%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. Try to concentrate on subject-specific terminology in the topic taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle pages."

Amber,"Sara shows determination to learn and is always engaging in class. Her writing and listening skills, however, need further development, as she has scored below 50% in her listening and writing assessment to date, which is below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Pink,"You have worked hard in Arts this term, so well done. You are sometimes reluctant to contribute in class, but when you do so, you have valuable contributions to make - so it would be good to hear more from you. Your assignment mark was good, and provided a good foundation for better marks in your summative work. All in all, you should be please with this term's work and there is plenty for you to build on in the New Year."
Green,Sara is an able student who needs to grow in her confidence. Her attendance has been very good and she has shown a good understanding of this subject. Sara should now concentrate on revising her notes and raising the sophistication of her interpretations by working on her written communication. A delight to have in the classroom.
Pink,"Sara's attendance levels has been excellent. 

She could improve on her participation as she will have the opportunity to apply what we learn in class more if she tries to speak and discuss about it.

I do think that she needs to put a bit more effort in her studies in order to guarantee progression. 

Her assessment was good but she needs to do a bit better. She has the capacity to do so most definitely."
Amber,Sara is a hard-working and conscientious student. She listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. She has handed all of her homework in on time. Sara has achieved over 60%  in CW1 but she still needs to work harder to improve her writing and listening skills. Attending virtual office hours and doing additional independent writing and listening tasks on Moodle are recommended to help her meet the overall English language requirement and the sub-requirement in writing for her chosen degree.
Green,"Latterly your marks have really started to improve, a result of your hard work: well done. You have started to participate regularly in class and much of what you say is astute and pertinent - well done. You were ultimately successful with Summative 1 and your Formative 2 was also very good. Both of these give you a strong foundation to work from for Summative 2, so carry on engaging with secondary literature and the primary texts in order to ensure ultimate success in the module."
Green,"Sara is a strong student with great potential. She has demonstrated great commitment to her studies and is an active member of our class. I am confident that Sara will do very well and needs only to work a little harder on her written English, something she ran into trouble with in her early formative and summative assessment. Nonetheless, I have full faith in her capability and believe she will perform strongly in the final assessment a few weeks from now. My biggest advice to Sara is that she must showcase her learning in this subject through the successful use of film and media terminology, and awareness of broader interaction of media texts with audiences and society at large. She must focus on the learning outcomes and ensure these are fully met."
Amber,"Sara has been improving throughout the year. She managed to attain a 60 mark in her S1 resit, which is not a bad mark. With a bit more push as we go in the final term she will be able to attain a progression mark."

Amber,"Walter is a conscientious individual who has set goals for personal achievement and is working diligently to attain them. He is in the process of developing suitable research skills necessary in the preparation for academic presentations as well as academic writing tasks. He enjoys sharing his ideas and concerns in small group discussions. Walter is encouraged to concentrate on achieving his personal goals for the next term, including a more confident approach to new and challenging learning situations. His listening and writing skills require further improvement. Therefore, it is recommended that Walter does independent study over his winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book."
Amber,"Walter has made a positive start to the year. His style is a little bit laid back (he can be a little bit late for class and low energy in class), but when he is asked he engages with the work in class and although his first assignment mark was below the required standard I am confident with a little more work he will develop well."
Green,"Your participation is good in class. You demonstrate some understanding of the subject. You have put in a good level of effort into your work. Your score is 65% to keep up your work. You need to make the considerable effort of making notes on paper, you need to be more active and your aim should be to improve your score by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Pink,"Walter has to improve on many levels if he is to progress.

First, he needs to improve on his attendance levels and his participation in class. He needs to put much more effort in studying and learning if he is to manage progression. 

His assessment reflects a boy who did not take University seriously yet and who needs to improve of his effort and studying methods and skills."
Amber,"Walter builds positive relationships with his peers and tutors. He has made noticeable progress in terms of his reading and research skills, as demonstrated in CW1 where he was awarded a mark of 65%. However, his writing skills need further improvement as he scores on average approx. 40% in AES writing mock exams. What is more, Walter has been advised to continue working on improving his comprehension and fluency in Academic English throughout term 3. This can be achieved with the use of Mock exam practice as well as independent study materials available on the Moodle every week."
Pink,"Walter has made some progress in developing his study skill and his application to the course. However, success on the course remains a big challenge for him as he often finds understanding of the concepts difficult. This appears to be as a result of his lack of attention in class as he finds it hard to concentrate. If he is to succeed then he now needs to address this lack of focus and concentrate on his work."
Amber,"Walter - While you have attended most of my classes this term, you don't show much initiative to answer or participate in our group discussions. You need to concentrate more in class too and memorise subject-specific terminology. Having said this, it is clear to me that you are putting in considerable effort independently and outside of calls, since your summative -1 score is 63%. It would be good to see you bring what you know to class and add to the diversity of voices for the benefit of others and yourself."
Green,"Walter has improved considerably since last term. He started speaking much more in class and participating more as well. 
This improvement can be seen in his S1 and S1 resit results. While his S1 was not that good, his S1 resit was excellent and he showed a commitment towards attaining a progression grade."

He is usually focused and sometimes contributes ideas and information to the class, but occasionally needs reminders to stay on task and complete written tasks to the best of his ability. Abdelrahman is encouraged to participate more frequently in class and group discussions and ask questions to clarify meaning and ensure understanding. His writing skills require further improvement. Therefore, it is recommended that Abdelrahman does independent study over his winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book. He should also attend academic writing workshops in Term 2, which will help him develop his writing skills."
Pink,"You have engaged with the course fully in the classroom, participating in both classes and lectures. Well done. You seem to struggle a bit more with group work on occasion - be careful that you remain focussed. Your assignment was disappointing for a student of your quality, but there are aspects of it that you can work on to ensure that you can improve for next time. Overall, you have done some good work this term, but there is plenty for you to work on in the New Year to ensure success further down the line."
Amber,"Abdelrahman is an able student with good potential to pass and potentially progress on to his chosen degree. Abdelrahan's formative 1 results were a little disappointing, but following a one-to-one tutorial I am confident he has understood where he went wrong, and will dedicate himself to working harder on his summative 1 assessment."
Amber,"Dido has to improve in order to achieve progression mark.

He has to pay more attention in class and focus on the topics of discussion. He has to put more effort in studying and learning, otherwise he will be left with an unpleasant surprise end of the year.

He is more than able to progress but he has to take studying seriously."
Amber,"Abdelrahman has made some progress in several areas of his academic study over the two terms at RHISC. He shares his ideas during group presentations and is a co-operative, respectful individual. Abdelrahman worked hard in term 2 in order to improve his writing skills and managed to achieve a mark of 54% in the formal formative writing exam. He should continue to work on improving his writing skills with the use of Mock Exams as well as independent study materials available on the Moodle.  If Abdelrahman continues to work hard next semester, he will increase his chance of achieving the required progression mark of 70% in Writing, pass the IFY programme and achieve the grades needed for progression to his chosen UG course at Royal Holloway."
Amber,"Your Summative 1 was a very good piece of work - well done. Your Formative 2 was not so successful, but if you can learn from this, then you should do much better in your Summative 2. Sometimes you do not try as hard as you could in Arts - and this is the time to be engaging with the course as fully as possible. Try and participate as much as possible in class - and engage with all the materials, including the primary texts and secondary literature to ensure success with the final stage of the module."
Amber,"There is no reason why Abdelrahman should not pass this module, and has full potential to also progress on to his chosen degree. Abdelrahan's summative 1 results were a little disappointing, despite a one-to-one tutorial held to help him has understand where he went wrong with his formative assessment. To achieve his potential, Abdelrahman should focus his energies on reading model answers and practising his writing skills and skills of analysis."
Amber,"Dido has done well until now but he needs to push a bit more in order to attain a progression mark. His S1 resit was in the range of 60 and he seems to have put some effort in it. As mentioned above, he needs to show a bit more commitment and determination in order to attain a progression mark."

Her listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as she has scored below 40% in her listening assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Amber,"You work hard in Arts and this paid off with a good mark for the assignment, but unfortunately your assignment was too long. Next time, make sure you observe the word limit! Nonetheless, you have a good foundation for your summative assignment. However, you have made a lot of progress in Arts this term, so you should be pleased. However, you remain very quiet in class. It is clear that you have plenty to say - and what you have to say is a valuable contribution, but you tend not to say anything. You should aim to change this as this will really help gain more from your classes."
Pink,"Ruodan is very hard-working, she regularly prepares for classes, and participates in the discussions. However, at the moment the main impediment to reach progression remains her low English proficiency. I'd recommend to focus on improving her English and academic writing over the next few weeks."
Pink,"Rachel's level of attendance has been excellent.

She can improve on her participation in class as she will be able to imporive on her language skills only if she applies her knowledge. She can do that either in our classes or during workshops which she is attending. 

She is putting a lot effort in her studies and I do believe that this effort will eventually pay off. With Rachel the issue is language and her level of language will only improve from here. 

Her assessment was not that good but she understood how she can improve on her results."
Pink,Rachel is a hard-working and conscientious student. She listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. She has handed all of her homework in on time. Rachel has achieved 70%  in CW1 but she still needs to work harder to improve her listening and writing skills. Attending virtual office hours and doing additional independent listening and writing tasks  on Moodle are recommended so as to help her meet the overall English language requirements and the sub-requirement in writing for her chosen degree.
Green,"You have worked very hard in Arts, ensuring that you have ultimately been successful in your Summative Assignment. Your Formative 2 is also relatively strong setting up a solid foundation for Summative 2, and you have the tools to perform well. Overall, you should be pleased. You have also started to contribute more to class discussion - and this has been a crucial part of your development. Keep this up when we go online!"
Green,"Ruodan'e essay for the Summative Assessment 1, as well as her contributions during the class discussions, show an impressive progress. She has exhibited good knowledge and understanding of politics and an increased confidence to engage herself in various class debates. I recommend that she focuses on improving her English proficiency, especially at the verbal level."
Amber,Rachel has done remarkable improvement during the past months. She has put effort in her studying and has shown commitment to studying. She needs to continue with the same commitment and I am sure she will be able to progress.

His formative results are pleasing and I believe he will do well in his academic career. He works well on individual tasks, but one further aspect of his studies he could improve upon is his contribution to tasks that require group discussion; by showing greater engagement would help to improve learning and the group dynamic."
Green,Yeran is a very good student. His level of attendance is very good. He has a very good level of understanding and he prepares his homework. He is advised to participate more in the class as he is a quite student.
Amber,"You demonstrate some command of the subject Your score is 57%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class. Usually, an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions. You need to focus a little more in class. Your performance is good but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Pink,"Yeran's level of attendance is good but he can improve on that. 

The same goes for his level of participation. He should stop sitting in the back row in the lecture (but also in the seminar) as the back row does not allow you to pay attention to the subject.

He needs to increase his effort in studying and try to engage more with our discussions. His English language skills are good and he seems to be a smart boy; he has to show more determination and effort.

His assessment results were fair but he can improve a lot if he follows the guidelines above."
Amber,"Yeran's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have been overall positive. His term 1 results have, however, highlighted that his speaking is weaker than any other skills and so he needs to dedicate more time and preparation to improving his speaking skills. His grade for CW1 were disappointing and they did not accurately reflect his ability. For Term 3 I hope that he will show a better commitment to CW2 and CW3 because I believe that by focusing and being committed and seeking help when needed with exams and assignments, I am confident that he will succeed on the IFY."
Green,Yeran is an excellent student. His attendance is good this term. His participation in the class is poor although his understanding in Maths is good. He has a good background in Maths and he is able to solve all the questions during the class. Yeran should continue to work hard and participate more during the class to ensure progression.
Amber,"Yeran - Your level of attendance is good in class, you need to take initiative in participating in class discussions. Your score for summative-1 is  57%, you have put in a reasonable level of effort into your work. Your result in assessments has been fair so far to ensure progression but needs to stretch yourself further. Try to concentrate more on subject-specific terminology in the topics taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle page"
Pink,"Yeran's level of commitment is letting him down. I believe he has the potential and progress to University but he does not show adequate level of commitment and determination to studying and learning. He seems to always be occupied with other things and does not show adequate commitment to learning.
His S1 result was not that good (53) and he did not do a resit. He did not do an F2 assignment either."

She has improved since the beginning of the term but her weaker skills require further improvement. It is important that she engages in independent study over the winter break using resources available to her on Moodle and in her AES textbook."
Green,"You have generally worked hard this term - well done. However, your formative assignment received a deduction - this is something to be mindful of for next time. Although you have generally been a very good student, there are times when you seem a bit distracted, and you should ensure that you maintain focus at all times. However, you have laid solid foundations for next year - and you should be generally pleased with what you have achieved."
Amber,Iliana's formative essay and her contributions during lectures and seminars show a good knowledge of global politics. She is conscientious and comes prepared for classes. I recommend to focus on improving academic writing.
Pink,"Iliana has an issue with attendance as she is constantly late in lectures. Her attendance in seminars is also patchy.

Her participation in class is fair but can improve a lot. She has the capabilities and I do not understand why she does not challenge herself.

She needs to concentrate more in what she came here to do; that is to study and progress. This lack of concentration and effort is reflected also in her assignment."
Amber,"Iliana has been a good student following her tutor`s advice since the beginning of the term 1, which is reflected on her assessment results positively. She also attends the classes regularly and takes part in class discussions and pair works, However, her writing and presentation skills require further improvement. She can practise presentation language and critical thinking using different topics. She can also refer to moodle for reference. Reviewing term 1 and 2 materials on moodle will also help her perfom better in term 3 and AES CW3."
Amber,"Your Summative 1 was very good - well done. Your Formative 2 was not as good, but we have had a constructive conversation about what went wrong - and you should be able to write a much better Summative 2, as you have been working hard all year and have a solid basis to work from. Carry on participating in class, engaging with the primary texts and reading secondary literature to make sure that your Summative 2 is successful."
Green,"Iliana's submission for the Summative Assessment 1, as well as her class participation have shown depth of knowledge and very good research skills. She is contentious and allocates a lot of time for independent study. I am confident that she will achieve progression, but I would advise her to focus on improving her academic writing skills (especially, the use of sources and paraphrasing)."
Green,My previous comments seem to have gotten into Iliana's head. She has shown an improvement in both attendance and participation in class and this is also reflected in her mark. I believe she has even more potential than this and she should continue to push herself.

Green,"Ahmed demonstrates good listening, speaking and reading skills. His writing skills, however, need further development as he has scored below progression requirement in his writing assessment to date. Reviewing the writing materials available on moodle and in his text book over the winter break is likely to improve his writing skills. In addition to this, Ahmed should dedicate sometime to research  so that he can get a head start on the coursework portfolio."
Amber,Ahmed is a good student. He is generally focussed in class and although he does not normally participate in class discussions he is able to answer well when he is asked directly. He appears to have a good grasp of the key concepts and also has good critical reasoning. His first assignment result was a little disappointing and he should make sure that he listens carefully to the feedback. If he takes the feedback from assignments and continues to apply the same level of focus to his studies then I am very optimistic about Ahmed's chance of success on the course.
Pink,Ahmed is a student that has not shown his full potential. He has missed lots of lessons and is strongly advised to attend all his lessons next term. He is usually very quiet in class. He should participate more and ask questions. His exam results can be improved with hard work in order to cover the parts of the course that has missed.
Amber,"You demonstrate some command of the subject Your score is 60%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class. Usually, an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions. You need to focus a little more in class. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Amber,"Ahmed shows a keen interest in learning and practising in class. He attends the classes regularly and takes part in pair work and group discussions. Although he has got good marks in all areas, reviewing the class materials on moodle will help him in term 3. He can also benefit from doing mock exams, which can be found on Moodle."
Amber,Ahmed is a generally good student with some talent. He participates in class discussion from time to time and is normally able to answer questions when asked. His summative assessment result was good and if he can maintain this level of work then he will succeed overall on the course.
Pink,"Ahmed needs to improve his attendance in Maths. He shows interest to improve in Maths, but during the class he participates poorly. His skills will only develop through application and practice. He puts insufficient effort into his work. He must hold himself to higher standards. Ahmed should study harder for Maths in order to meet the required standards."
Amber,"Ahmed - While you have attended most of my classes this term, and are usually an active participant in class discussions you do at times get distracted in the class. Nonetheless, your summative -1 score is an excellent 75%. Your knowledge and understanding of the topics therefore secure and you should now think about stretching yourself. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."

Pink,"Amir is a pleasant and conscientious student who is adapting to his new academic environment. He has a good understanding of the required skills, and he is making efforts to implement these skills into his classwork and thus assessments. He already possesses good listening and speaking skills and this is reflected in his formative assessment results, and the areas he needs to keep working on are writing and reading. By attending drop-in clinics and writing workshops and asking questions, I am confident that he will succeed on the IFY."
Amber,"Amir is a very good student who engages with the class and is very attentive. He has a reasonable grasp of the concepts although at times he needs a little more work to fully understand the topics. His formative results was a little disappointing, but if he listens carefully to the feedback and continues to maintain his high level of commitment then I fully expect Amir to succeed this year."
Green,76% formative 1 result.  Seyed pays attention in class and asks when he has difficulties and this is reflected in this first assessment.  He works well with his peers and ensures he has notes and example questions solved.
Amber,"Your score is 56%. You demonstrate some command of the subject and you have put in some good effort in your work; however, at times you need to be better engaged in class. You are an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions. If he can sustain or improve this, it will be a factor for success. You need to make a flow chart with the notes written by yourself, revise material posted on Moodle."
Pink,"Amir's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have yielded mixed results. Amir has shown that he has very good speaking and listening skills and this puts him in an advantageous position; however, his reading skills and particularly his writing skills are below the minimum requirement threshold. He scored satisfactorily in his CW1 assignment, although I believe this could have been higher had he spent more time on it during draft 1. However, he should not be discouraged by these marks because during term 2, Amir has made a noticeable improvement in both these skills when completing in-class and homework activities. It is evident that he has made a conscientious effort to work on aspects of his writing that are weak. I strongly believe that by continuing to be hard working and focused I am confident that he will succeed on the IFY."
Amber,"Amir continues to work with energy and commitment. He is a very good student who engages fully in class, concentrates well and participates in class discussions. His results have steadily improved, thanks largely to his hard work, and this means that I am very optimistic that Amir will succeed on the course overall."
Green,Summative 1 result 52%.  The summative 1 result does not reflect the grade achieved in formative 1 and this was a little disappointing although there were some more difficult concepts to understand. Seyed was making an effort to understand the concepts for the resit and he must continue independent problem solving and asking for support as needed.  Seyed must now also concentrate on the statistics component of the course to ensure his understanding to put it into practise.
Amber,Amir -  You demonstrate good understanding in class and are an active participant on the whole. Your summative-1 score is  71 %. This is a very commendable score. Now my suggestion would be to begin stretching yourself and to this you should engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and on Moodle.

Pink,"Jiajun demonstrates good listening skills and tries to contributes in class. Although he is quite active in group works, he might be distracted during individual work due to the complexity of the task so it is important to come to class prepared to be able to participate more and benefit more from AES classes. Attending writing and listening workshops and doing extra homework on Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,"68% formative 1 result.  Jiajun performs well in class and whilst this result could be better, the errors are still minor and can be resolved in preparation for the next assessment.  He must learn the specialist language of Decision Maths to support his understanding of the questions."
Amber,Jiajun is a very good student. His interest for learning and improvement is great. His attendance is very good. He always is willing to help other students and he likes teamwork. This is a great value for a student. The last period Jiajun does not concentrate a lot in the class. This has lead him to make a quick report that does not show his skills. His results will be very good if his effort will increase.
Green,Jiajun is a great student. His attendance is very good. He follows the class and he does his homework. He has a great potential.
Amber,"Jiajun shows interest in classes and determined to learn but he needs to make more effort to actively contribute to class discussions. His reading and listening skills have improved significantly since the beginning of the term, however, his writing and speaking skills require further improvement. It is important that he engages in independent study using the resources available to him on Moodle and in his AES textbook."
Green,"Jiajun's formative 2 result was a little disappointing but not unsurmountable.  Jiajun needs to review the paper and practise the concepts he found difficult, ensuring he understands the terminology.  However, his understanding of Decision Maths is good and a successful achievement for his summative assessments is to be expected."
Amber,Jiajun has shown a great attendance in the class. He is always interested and he participates in the class. He is able to solve exercises and answer questions in physics. His lab report was good. However Jiajun could achieve better. He needs to concentrate a bit more and to be more conscientious. His results in formative assessment were very good (80%).
Amber,"Jiajun had great attendance during this term. He engages in the class and he shows great progress in Maths. As his assessment results  did not show Jaijun's potential, Jiajun need to work and practise more. He must hold himself to higher standards.  Also he should not hesitate to ask for help from his tutor if he needs more exercises or he wants some more explanation. If he follows these, Jiajun will be successful in his final exams."

Green,"Jayden is an active and bright student who usually comes prepared to class and contributes to discussions. She is good at both pair work and group work. She can review the writing materials, especially content source parts to excel in writing. In addition to this, she should dedicate some time to research so that she can have a head start for term 2 and her Course Work 1."
Pink,48% formative 1 result.  Jayden works really hard in class but needs to be asking more specific questions on the areas she does not understand.  Although her timetable does not support her attendance at either maths workshop Jayden should  ask for help on Thursdays at 11:30 and will again be reminded of this in the next term.
Green,"Level of attendance and participation is excellent in class.

She puts commendable level of effort into her work.

She is making excellent progress, has an excellent command of the subject and has excelled in everything. Her results in assessments have been excellent also."
Green,"Jayden is undoubtedly the best student in this cohort. 

She is very studious and with attention to detail. She puts a lot of effort in her studying and she will be rewarded with her marks.

She had the top grade in the entire cohort."
Green,"Jayden demonstrates good skills in all areas, however, she should dedicate some time to timed writing in her own time. She shows a keen interest in learning and usually completes her tasks in time successfully. Although she has got good marks in all areas, reviewing the class materials on moodle and doing exam practices will help her in term 3 too."
Amber,Summative 1 result 37%.  The effort Jayden puts in to class and independent work is just not reflected in the pure maths assessment results.  Jayden needs to believe in herself and keep practising.  The term 2 statistics component can reflect more accurately her diligence and underlying understanding.
Green,Jayden has been hands down one of the best students in this cohort. Excellent level of attendance and excellent results in all assignments.
Green,"Jayden is undoubtedly one of the best students in this cohort. Her results, attendance and overall performance attest to this."

Amber,"Elian participates in group activities with enthusiasm and works well with others, but often needs reminders and encouragement to begin tasks and remain focused in class. She is generally a considerate student and yet she continues to have some difficulty completing homework assignments on time. Elian is encouraged to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude. Establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of Elian's main goals in term 2."
Pink,"Your Formative Assignment gives you a chance to learn what you need to do better for your Summative Assignment next term. We have discussed what you can learn from this; you have an idea of what to work on. Inside the classroom, you should try and be a bit more focused on the matter at hand - and concentrate on what's happening in the classroom. It would also be good to hear more from you as you are incredibly quiet and starting to participate more, both in group and class discussions, would help you develop as a student."
Amber,"Elian is a confident student with good potential. My only concern is with her commitment to her studies. Elian needs to do more to show that she is fully engaging with the material and with her sessions which, to be fair, she is attending regularly. Nonetheless, her engagement in these sessions could be stronger and to aid this my advice would be for her to work even harder in improving her spoken English. Alongside this, I would advise her to make notes more regularly in our sessions and revise these after our sessions."
Pink,Xinuy has not been showing the adequate commitment for Sociology. She has constantly been on her phone despite constant comments by me. She is not paying attention to class and this has been reflected in her assignment as well.
Pink,"In term 2, it has been noticed that Elian's level of participation in AES live classes dropped to an alarming level. The student has not engaged with the coursework and has not completed her homework assignments on time. Lack of engagement and participation has resulted in the student submitting a poor quality assignment for CW1. To alleviate this, Elian is encouraged to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude. Establishing a consistent study plan and following a solid homework / independent study routine must be prioritised in term 3. Elian should also attend VOH and use this opportunity to ask the AES tutors any questions she might have about what is expected of her in this course."
Amber,"Your formative work was very good - well done. However, we have had a chat about how you could engage better in class and how this would help you as we move into the final phase of the course. Ultimately this will help you as you come to focus on progression, which is your aim right now. You need to keep that focus, ensuring that you work hard on Formative 2 and Summative 2. The first way you are going to do that is by engaging more in class and we have discussed strategies for you to do that. I look forward to seeing those in action - and the results of that in due course."
Pink,"Elian under performed in summative 1 and achieved the lowest grade in the class. This is surprising as Elian is not a weak student. Her challenge is her commitment and discipline. She needs to exert more effort by engaging the content being covered in class. She needs to use the model answers for her resit of s1 and completion of summartive 2. She needs to approach this more intelligently; after all, all assessments are tools ultimately designed to test a student and help the student showcase their learning. This is what Elian must concentrate on."
Pink,"Xinuy has shown a bit of commitment following the releasing of S1 and the realisation that she is in danger of not passing. She has shown some attention to class and has been trying to answer some questions. While I do not know whether she will be able to pass/progress, she should continue showing dedication in improving her marks."

Amber,"Odai demonstrates good speaking skills and makes frequent contributions to class discussions. He usually investigates and obtains information independently and does well in terms of sharing his findings in front of the class. However, his listening skills need further development, as he scored below 40% in the continuous listening assessment during class time. What is more, Odai should continue working on his writing skills and take on board the feedback he has received so far. It is recommended that Odai does independent study using resources available on  Moodle, which is likely to help him achieve his goals for academic study."
Pink,"You have worked very hard in class, asking pertinent questions and working to make progress in a subject area that is new to you. However, your Formative Assignment, as we have discussed, is not reflective of that - and so you will have to work hard for your Summative Assignment in order to be assured of success. This has therefore been a mixed term for you, but with the right work you can be successful in Arts."
Pink,"Even though Odai failed Formative Assessment 1, he has shown a lot of determination and self-discipline in catching up. I was very impressed with the homework he submitted on the British Court System: he showed depth of knowledge and precision with the technical language. I am confident that if he keeps up with the independent study and submits his homework on time, he will reach progression."
Amber,"Odai seems to be a very focused boy, who although being late to join the class has been keen to catch up with the rest of the class. Although his formative has not been good, he has all the capabilities to progress."
Green,"Odai has engaged well with the online delivery mode and demonstrated a high level of participation in the AES live classes. It is hoped that the student will remain as focused throughout term 3. It is recommended that Odai continues working on his writing skills and takes on board the feedback he has received so far. Academic skills practice using the mock exams available on the WISEflow platform is crucial in the coming weeks. Odai should also put some time aside to start preparing for his CW2 summative presentation as well as CW3 extended researched essay, both of which are due in term 3."
Amber,"You have worked very hard and it is beginning to pay off so well done. At the start of the course you were undoubtedly lacking in confidence, but now you are showing that you have more to say and that you are spending time engaging with texts. This was reflected in a strong mark for Summative 1, and I think that you have the capacity to do well for your second Formative and onwards as well. You need to maintain that focus and keep on working hard in order to make sure that you are successful."
Amber,Odai's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 shows a very good progress. He is conscientious and works very hard to improve his knowledge and subject-related skills. I am confident that the Resit grade will better mirror his knowledge and abilities.
Green,"Odai is a very dedicated and committed young man and this is shown with his S1 result, the top in class. His performance both during class and in the assessments has been excellent. He should be proud with his results and should continue with the same dedication and commitment."

Amber,"Mueed is a little quiet in class, but it can be seen that he is trying to incorporate the skills into his writing and group discussions. One particular aspect that he could work on and develop is the ability to show greater depth of critical thinking when approaching a topic and to support his points with evidence from credible sources. He needs to focus on further developing his listening and writing skills, and for his writing he can make use of the drop-in sessions to get some useful tips on academic writing to achieve the required writing grade."
Amber,"You did well on your formative assignment - well done. However, your attitude in class is more problematic. You rarely engage with class discussion and do not really take an active part in group work. In order to continue to improve, this needs to change so that you can continue to develop as a student - as we will discuss in your tutorial. It would be good to see you working harder and trying to engage with the course in a more meaningful way."
Amber,"Mueed has contributed a lot in the beginning in the class discussions. He has shown a good knowledge of politics, however he needs to allocate more time for independent study and for doing the homework on weekly basis in order to achieve progression."
Amber,"Mueed's attendance levels have been affected by the Friday prayers he is attending. This is an issue that I believe has been resolved with the intervention of Syed.

His participation in class is good but can improve even more. He can try to take more initiative and try to talk more in classes.

While his effort has been adequate, I believe he can do better and show a bit more more determination towards studying Sociology, even though he does not like it. 

His assessment was good but he can improve a lot on it if he shows a bit more determination and effort in studying Sociology."
Amber,"Mueed's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have yielded satisfactory results. His reading skills are his strongest skill, however speaking, writing and listening are averaging 50% and they need to be improved upon in order to meet progression. By investing more time and with more careful preparation and commitment, he will see improved results. During term 2, Mueed has made improvements when completing in-class and homework activities so keep up the good work. I believe that by continuing to be focused and committed in Term 3 and seeking help when needed I am confident that he will succeed on the IFY."
Pink,"We have already discussed your non-submission of your Formative 2, which makes it hard for me to see your progress through the course of this term, but I look forward to reading your work. Your Summative 1 showed that you need to work hard to ensure that you score a mark that will get you over the progression threshold - and for that, you will need to focus in Arts. Historically, you have struggled to do this, so this is the time for change. You need to take an active part in class, read the texts and engage with the materials for success in June."
Green,"Mueed's grade for the Summative Assessment 1 shows a great improvement. He showed good knowledge of politics and an increased confidence and precision in writing. As we are moving online in the last semester, I recommend that he completes the homework regularly and he allocates enough time for independent study."
Green,"Mueed has done extremely well in his S1 resit. While his overall attendance and contribution in class were not of the highest standard, his performance in S1 resit was excellent (85). He needs to continue showing a determination and commitment  and I have no doubts he will be progressing."

Amber,Lingzhi is a cooperative student who works well with other classmates. He shows self-direction in goal-setting and goal achievement and has made some good progress over this term. He consistently scored over 50% in his in-class listening assessment and demonstrated some improvement is his speaking as well as academic writing. He is responsive to feedback and builds positive relationships with his peers and tutors. Lingzhi should dedicate some time during his winter break to researching his CW1 to give himself a head start on researching the topic in Term 2.
Amber,"Lingzhi is a good student. He is attentive and engaged in class, although he could participate more in class discussions. He is able to answer questions well when directly asked and has a good understanding of key concepts. His first assignment was good although he still has some room to improve based on listening to the feedback."
Amber,"You demonstrate some understanding of the subject Your score is 57%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class. Usually, you not an active participant in class discussions Need to focus a little more in class. You need to make notes in class, please improve your concentration level in class, your performance can be better your aim should be to improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Amber,"Lingzhi's level of attendance is very good. 

Participation is satisfactory but he can practice and apply more the skills he learns if he tries to speak more in class.

His results have been satisfactory but he needs to improve in order to progress."
Green,"Lingzhi has established goals for his academic achievement and is working diligently to attain them. He has experienced good progress in many areas of his academic study over the past two terms. Lingzhi shares his ideas and research skills in preparing for group presentations and is a co-operative, responsible individual. Careful planning and a conscientious attitude are positive aspects of his class participation and behaviour. He consistently scores over 50% for listening in the continuous assessment (60% in the last mock exam before the break) and achieved a score of 61% in the last academic writing mock exam. He is responsive to feedback and builds positive relationships with his peers and tutors. What is more, Lingzhi has made noticeable progress in terms of his reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where he was awarded a mark of 73%. Lingzhi is to be congratulated on his achievements and encouraged to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout Term 3."
Amber,"Lingzhi has good potential, but his level of engagement and motivation in term 2 has gone down. This is disappointing mainly because unless Lingzhi applies himself to his studies he is at real risk of not succeeding on the course. Lingzhi needs to organise himself to undertake the work consistently and thoroughly. If he does this he has some chance of success on the course overall."
Amber,"Lingzhi - You show some understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  60% Your results in assessments have been fair so far. Improve your concentration level. You should be more focused work hard to your potential use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle"
Pink,"Marco is between Pink and Amber and I have gone with Pink because I believe he has not shown the adequate commitment and determination to achieve a progression mark.
While his attendance has been very good to excellent, he did not do very good in S1 and while he put his name down for a  Resit he eventually failed to submit one. 
I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed with Marco becuase I believe he had the capabilities to progress but he did not show adequate levels of commitment.
His F2 results also show that he needs to put a lot of work if he is to progress."

Green,"Ibrahim is a conscientious student and is well-liked by his classmates. He contributes well to class and to group discussion activities. He possesses strong English language skills which place him in good stead, and he has also demonstrated a good understanding of the teaching material in Term 1 and attempts to transfer this into his classwork and homework. His mock exams have overall been pleasing and I am confident that with more careful preparation and regular practice, Ibrahim will do very well on the IFY."
Green,"Ibrahim is a good student. He is a positive and energetic member of the class and is usually fully engaged in classes. He offers a good contribution to class discussions and is a positive influence on the atmosphere in the class. In order to improve he could be a little more systematic and organised - for example, taking more notes and being more thorough will reading, etc. However, with some minor changes I am optimistic that Ibrahim can succeed on the course."
Green,"Ibrahim - You are a pleasure to teach. You have demonstrated an excellent command of the subject. You participate in class discussions and show interest in raising important and relevant questions. This is clearly shown in your formative 1 score, which is 72%. I believe you will be more stimulated and engaged in Moodle, independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Pink,"Unfortunately, Ibrahim did not submitted his Formative Assessment 1 even though he was granted a generous extension. Based on his participation in class, I believe he is likely to reach progression but he needs to work very hard and manage his workload better."
Green,"There has been a noticeable change in Ibrahim's commitment to his English studies since moving to the new mode of teaching, which is a little concerning as this was not an issue when we were having face to face lessons. He has so far shown himself to be less engaged and motivated in terms of carrying out his weekly MOODLE tasks and his attendance at live ZOOM sessions has also been low. I'm hoping that in the coming weeks he'll step up and focus more on his CW1 final draft, better engage in a more timely manner with his mock exams in order to be better placed for his summatives at the end of term 2."
Amber,"Ibrahim is a student with some talent, but he needs to harness this talent by applying himself to the work. His summative 1 result was a little disappointing considering how well he is able to engage with the topics in class. He needs to apply himself to his studies to actually learn some new ideas/concepts rather than rely on his already good knowledge. Unless he does this he will gradually find his studies harder. He also needs to maintain good attendance in class to support this."
Green,"Ibrahim -You are a pleasure to teach. You have demonstrated an excellent command of the subject. You participate in class discussions and show interest in raising important and relevant questions. This is clearly shown in your summative 1 score, which is 65%. I believe you will be more stimulated and engaged in Moodle, independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Amber,"Ibrahim's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 was good but rushed through. I believe his grade in Resit will better reflect his knowledge of the subject and the ease with which he engages with it. He needs to devote regularly time to completing the homework, and most importantly to improve his time management skills."

Green,"Eduardo is a conscientious student who contributes well to class and to group discussion activities. He often extends discussion by imparting his own knowledge and thoughts on certain discussion points. He possesses good English language skills which places him in good stead, and he has also demonstrated a good understanding of the teaching material in Term 1 and he has used it in his written work. His mock exams have overall been pleasing and I am confident that with more careful preparation and regular practice, he will do very well on the IFY."
Green,Eduardo is an excellent student. He is very committed and motivated to succeed in his studies and he has the talent to do very well indeed. His formative 1 result was good and there is plenty of opportunity for this to improve as he develops his skill and knowledge going forward. Eduardo makes a very positive and valuable contribution to class discussion and his confident and articulate style are very positive for the class overall. I am very confident that Eduardo will be very successful on the course overall.
Amber,"Eduardo -  Your pleasure to teach, you show significant interest in the class participates in group discussions, your score for formative -1 is 63%.Your performance is good but needs to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Pink,"Even though Eduardo did not receive a good grade on the Formative Assessment 1, he has become more conscientious since. His class contributions have been very valuable and he has shown an increased sophistication in the use of the political science terminology. I believe that he is very likely to succeed if he devotes more time to independent study on regular basis and improves on his self-discipline."
Green,"Since transitioning over to the new mode of teaching, Eduardo has remained a conscientious and hard-working student who contributes well to class and to group discussion activities. He  actively engages and completes the MOODLE tasks every week; he engaged with the MOCK exams in a timely manner and submitted CW1 draft 1 on time. I am still very confident that with more careful preparation and regular practice, he will do very well on the IFY and progress onto his chosen degree."
Green,Eduardo remains a very talented and committed student. He contributes very well to class discussions and has a very good understanding of key concepts. His result for summative 1 reflected both his capability and his hard work during the last few months. I fully expect Eduardo to succeed on this course and in his future studies.
Green,"Eduardo -  Your pleasure to teach, you show significant interest in the class participates in group discussions, your score for summative -1 is 62%.Your performance is good but needs to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Green,"Eduardo's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 shows a great progress from the Formative. In the last months, he has engaged diligently with the subject and completed the homework every week. I appreciate a lot his comments during the seminar: they show knowledge and insight. I am confident that he will meet the progression requirements."

Amber,"Zimo welcomes new tasks and seeks new opportunities for learning. However, at times she needs encouragement to work to the best of her ability. She also needs reminders to stay focused on the task at hand. Zimo continues to seek tutor's clarification for assignments and is encouraged to include more detail and consider the marking criteria in completing her final work. She is also encouraged to ask questions to clarify meaning and ensure understanding. Based on the results of continuous formative assessment, it has been noted that Zimo's writing skills require further improvement. Therefore, she should continue working on her academic writing skills and take on board the feedback that she has received so far. It is recommended that Zimo does independent study using resources on the Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book."
Pink,"Zimo is a good student. She concentrates in class and is well organised, taking notes. However, her formative 1 result was disappointing and this is generally due to her lack of skill in english. Zimo needs to rapidly develop her english language skills and this means committing to immersing herself in the language for the duration of the course. If she can do this and continue to be organised and concentrate then she has a chance of progressing, however, without an improvement to her language then I am quite concerned about her chance of success."
Amber,"Zimo - You show significant interest in the class and this is to be encouraged, but unfortunately your score for  your formative -1 is a little lower (58%) than what you should be aiming for. You need to work on your writing skills as well as refine how you express your Economics knowledge. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Pink,"Zimo is very quiet during class and she rarely contributes in our discussions. As such, I have no way of knowing how much she understands. The couple of times I directly asked her she was able to answer but her formative assignment was not good at all. I believe that the issue she is faced with is her level of English communication and the only way she will be able to improve is by utilising the English language more often."
Green,"In term 2, Zimo has participated well and engaged well with the online delivery mode. Zimo has managed to stay on top of the AES assignments and CW1. It is hoped that this positive attitude towards her studies will continue throughout term 3. It is recommended that Zimo continues to seek her AES tutor's clarification and continues to ask questions about what is expected of her. The student should make the most of the mock exams available on the WISEflow platform to practise and prepare herself before her summative exams in June. Zimo should also put some time aside to start working on her CW2 summative presentation as well as CW3 extended researched essay, which are both due in term 3."
Amber,"Zimo continues to improve during the course. I am especially pleased with her summative 1 result. However, this is still not at a level that she needs to achieve in order to progress to her degree course at Royal Holloway. She must now take the guidance and feedback that is given to her in order to improve her summative result. She must also work hard to develop her skill in english as this remains the number one obstacle to her  future success on the course."
Green,"Zimo -You show interest in class and do participate in class discussions too, which has contributed to your score for summative -1 (62%) and this shows a clear improvement on your formative score. It shows that you have potential and so you need to working hard. To do this, spend more time taking notes in class and improve your writing skills further by attending the workshops (and other support) offered by AES. Also, you should engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,"While I was a bit worried about Zimo's English proficiency and ability to progress, she performed very good in her S1. She needs to continue showing this determination and focus in her studies, taking elaborate notes as she does and asking questions, and I am certain she will have no issues with progressing."

Amber,"Luiza welcomes new tasks with enthusiasm and seeks new opportunities for learning. However, at times she needs encouragement to work to the best of her ability. She also needs reminders to stay focused on the task at hand. She continues to seek teacher's clarification for assignments and is encouraged to ask questions to clarify meaning and ensure understanding. Greater focus in class would also help improve the quality of her academic work. Based on her overall performance and contribution to class, it is recommended that Luiza does independent study over her winter break using resources on Moodle and the Language Development section of the AES course book. This will help her ensure that she has not missed out on any important academic information or task practice covered in class over the duration of Term 1."
Green,"Your work in Arts is very good - well done. You make insightful contributions in class and you are not afraid to ask when you do not understand. Although attendance has been something of an issue for you, when you are there, you work hard. Your assignment mark was very good - and this provides an excellent basis for your work for your summative work early next term. All in all, you should be pleased."
Amber,"Luiza is an able student whose attendance and attention to detail is letting her down a little. Despite this though, her formative assessment for film and media studies was quite good. Luiza's success is entirely in her hand. If she dedicates herself to her studies, attends class more regularly and works with her peers closely, there is no reason why she cannot pass and progress to Royal Holloway."
Green,"Luiza is more than able to progress. She is a girl with huge potential, with its only obstacle other things in her mind. These do not allow her to focus in studying. 

As a result, she has not been putting the effort in studying sociology constantly and this is reflected with her assessment.

Luisa has so much potential and I would be sad to not see it fullfilled."
Amber,"Luiza demonstrates good speaking skills and makes frequent contributions to class discussions. However, her writing skills need further work and improvement as she scores on average approx. 40% in AES writing mock exams. Therefore, it is recommended that she does independent study using resources available on the Moodle, completes mock exams as set by her tutor and submits the compulsory AES tasks every week. If Luiza continues to work on her academic skills development in term 3, she should increase her chances of progression to her chosen UG course at Royal Holloway University of London."
Amber,"Your work in Arts can sometimes be somewhat varied in quality. Although your Summative 1 was not your most successful work, your Formative 2 was better - and puts you on a path for success with Summative 2. Your contributions in class are valuable and relevant, showing that you have thought about the texts and know how to interrogate them. You also work well in groups. In order to ensure success over the next term, you should continue to engage with the primary texts but also the secondary literature."
Amber,"Luiza is an able student with good potential. Despite personal difficulties, she has demonstrated commitment to her studies and is, mostly, an active member of our class. I am confident that Luiza will do well and needs only to think harder about how best communicate her vision in visual terms, something she ran into trouble with in her early formative and summative assessment. Nonetheless, I have full faith that she has learnt from this since and will perform strongly in the final assessment a few weeks from now."
Pink,Luiza has had a lot of extra curricula issues throughout the year. Her mind seemed to not be here and she did not pay adequate attention to learning and studying. This is reflected in her mark (50) and the fact that she did not do a resit. It will be very difficult for her to attain a progression mark in Sociology.

Amber,"Adeline is a conscientious individual who has set goals for personal achievement and is working diligently to attain them. She is in the process of developing suitable research skills necessary in the preparation for academic presentations as well as academic writing tasks. Adeline enjoys sharing her ideas and concerns in small group discussions. She continues to demonstrate a keen interest in learning and works well independently as well as with others. Adeline usually investigates a given topic and obtains information independently, and does well in terms of sharing her findings in front of the class. She should keep up the good work in term 2 in order to meet the specific progression criteria."
Green,"You have clearly worked hard in Arts this term. You have made a conscientious effort in class: you have taken notes and participated well in group work. On occasion, you also participate in class discussion and this is something it would be good to hear more of as your contributions are pertinent and meaningful. You just need to build up your confidence to do that! Your Formative Assignment was good, giving you a solid foundation for your Summative Assignment. Overall, you should be pleased."
Green,"Adeline is a wonderful student with great potential. She has demonstrated great commitment to her studies and is an active member of our class. I am confident that Adeline will do very well and needs only to work a little harder on her written English, something she ran into trouble with in her early formative assessment. Nonetheless, I have full faith in her capability and believe she will perform strongly in the first summative assessment a few weeks from now. My biggest advice to Adeline is that she must showcase her learning in this subject through the successful use of film and media terminology, and awareness of broader interaction of media texts with audiences and society at large."
Pink,"Wei did not do well in her formative with a mark of 43. Her assignment shows that she did not really understand what she was meant to do. She seems to also have English language issues, which need to improve."
Green,"In term 2, Adeline has participated well and engaged well with the online delivery mode. As a result, the student has managed to stay on top of the AES assignments and met the requirements of the course. It is hoped that this positive attitude towards her studies will continue throughout term 3. It is recommended that Adeline continues to seek her AES tutor's clarification and ask further questions in order to ensure understanding. The student should make the most of the mock exams available on the WISEflow platform to practise and prepare before she takes her summative exams in June. She should also put some time aside to start working on her CW2 summative presentation as well as CW3 extended researched essay, which are both due in term 3."
Amber,"You are working hard in Arts and it is paying off. Your Summative 1 mark was good and if you continue to work hard, hopefully you can do well in Formative 2 and beyond. You are also starting to contribute more in classes, which is a welcome development - and it's good to see and hear you make that progress, which will lead hopefully to better work in future. Carry on working hard, engaging with online work and hopefully things will improve."
Green,"Adeline is one of my top students. She is conscientious and hard working. Adline never misses class and is always on top of her work. She achieved the highest grade in class for summative 1, and I am now looking forward to her summative 2 submission. My advice to Adeline would be to study the model answer for s2 closely and try and model her own work on this. She needs to show critical awareness of issues and debates, a coherent vision for her portfolio as a whole, and creativity and imagination in her narrative and storyboard in particular."
Amber,"Wei has been excellent during our classes, contributing to discussion. Her S1 was not as good however as she go a mark in the range of 55. Following workshops and tutorials however, she (and myself) is confident she will be doing better in A resit. I am also confident that she will be able to portray her knowledge and understanding in the RESIT. She should continue with the same dedication and commitment and 100% she will be progressing."

Amber,"Xiaochuan has engaged with the online learning mode to some extent and submitted some of the compulsory AES tasks so far. He should take on board all the feedback he has received from the tasks he submitted and make improvements to the quality of his academic work, as suggested by his tutor. Establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of Xiaochuan's main goals. What is more, it is recommended that, over the next few weeks, Xiaochuan studies in his individual study time using AES study materials available on Moodle and works through the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to improve his chances of progression."
Pink,Xiaochuan has made a disappointing start to the course. His formative 1 result was one of the lowest in the group and this is mainly due to his lack of skill in English. He is also unable to contribute in class and even when asked direct questions is unable to answer. His biggest challenge now is to improve his english skills rapidly in order for him to have any chance of completing the course successfully and achieving his goals. He can do this by immersing himself in english language material.
Green,"Xiaochuan has a very good attendance in the Maths class. He has a good background in maths and he is interested in the class. His results in the formative assessment were very good. However, Xiaochuan should improve his language skills, as the communication is difficult in the class. Even if he knows the solutions in the maths questions, he cannot demonstrate it and he does not participate a lot."
Pink,"Gong - While your attendance is good and you are a well-mannered and polite student, you need to make more of an effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussions. Your score for your formative assessment was very low at 31%, which clearly shows a need to improve and better demonstrate your understanding. You need to work harder to reach your progression requirement, and for this you should attend workshops when they start again and book tutorials etc. for us to work together and keep track of your performance/improvement."
Amber,"Xiaochuan's engagement with the AES course and the online learning mode in term 2 has been satisfactory. The student should take on board the feedback he has received from his AES tutor and make improvements to the quality of his academic work. It is strongly recommended that, in term 3, Xiaochuan studies in his individual study time using AES study materials available on the Moodle, completes mock exams on the WISEflow platform and works through the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to improve his chances of progression to University."
Amber,Xiaochuan continues to have difficulty communicating in class. If he is to succeed on the course overall he needs to develop this skill significantly. The best way to do this is by spending a great deal of his time using English as his main language e.g. when using the internet/social media and watching films or listentng to music. His result in summative 1 was surprisingly good so it appears that he is able to understand the topic when specifically challenged. I am concerned that if Xiaochuan doesn't increase his focus he may not complete the course overall.
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance. Xiaochuan attends the classes regularly, but his camera and microphone are not working, so there is no real communication. He did not submit his S1 assessment in time. He clearly had technical difficulties, but did not contact his tutor. The work he submitted later shows a good understanding of the materials. In order to progress Xiaochuan should establish the regular contact with tutors by email. He should submit the homework regularly for feedback and prepare for S1 resit and S2 assessment."
Amber,"GONG - While your attendance is good and you are a well-mannered and polite student, you need and participate in group discussions. Your score for summative 1 assessment is 59%, which clearly shows there is an improvement,  you need to consider making notes and work on your writing skills as well as refine how you express your Economics knowledge. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."

Pink,"Yingbo demonstrates some understanding of the material covered in class. He attempts to make short contributions to class discussions, however, he continues to require regular assistance with some aspects of the academic programme. Yingbo has found it challenging to complete the compulsory homework assignments in the first two weeks of term 2. Therefore, establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of his main goals. Yingbo should attend the virtual office hours and try to catch up on what has been covered so far. It is recommended that Yingbo starts using study materials available on Moodle, which are likely to improve his chances of progression."
Pink,"Yingbo is a sincere and genuine student who is clearly motivated to succeed on the course. However, his english language skills are holding him back. His confidence in english has improved during the first term, but this now needs to accelerate if he is to succeed on the course overall. His formative 1 result was poor, but there is opportunity to improve if he continues to work at the level he has shown so far. Whether this will be enough to achieve progression is uncertain and the key to this will be development of his language skills."
Amber,"Yingbo has shown very good attendance in the class. He is usually very quiet in class, and that keeps him from achieving his full potential. He needs to considerably improve his level of contribution to class discussions. He should try to improve his language skills by participating more in the class and show his work. Yingbo is a diligent student who has a good background in maths. His results were very good in the formative assessment."
Amber,"Yingbo(Bob) - You show significant interest in the class, your score for formative -1 is 56%. You need to put in some good level of effort in your work and engage in class. You need to participate more in group discussion and enhance your communication skill which will help you in your writing skill, Your performance is fine but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Pink,"In term 2, Yingbo has not engaged with the AES course as well as was expected. It is hoped that in term 3 Yingbo's participation in the live classes as well as his academic performance will improve. In order to make this happen, the student should establish a consistent study plan and a solid homework / independent study routine every week. Yingbo should also attend the VOH and ask his AES tutors any questions he might have regarding good academic practice and avoiding plagiarism in academic work. To better prepare for the summative exams, Yingbo should use the study materials available on the Moodle as well as the mock exams available to students on the WISEflow platform."
Amber,"Yingbo remains a sincere student. However, his english language skills remain a significant challenge for him. He also lacks some focus in attending class on a regular basis. He has made progress with his english and this is good news, but this needs to be accelerated if he is going to succeed on the course overall.
His summative 1 result was very encouraging and shows that he is able to produce work of a good standard when needed."
Green,These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Yingbo attends the class regularly and participate in class discussions. He got a good result of 70% in his S1 coursework. I hope he will continue to work to the same standard and progress with a very good results.
Amber,"Yingbo - You showing some interest in the class, be more active in class you need to participate in group discussions, your score for summative -1 is 62%. Your performance is good but needs to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. You need to participate more in group discussion and enhance your communication skill which will help you in your writing skill, to do this please make a considerable amount of notes, independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle, other sources outlined in the lesson plan, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly"

Amber,"Taisei has done well in the first two weeks of term 2 by attending the AES classes online, showing continuous engagement with the course and submitting all compulsory AES tasks. This means that he has already received some valuable feedback. It is hoped that tutor's feedback and comments will help Taisei achieve higher marks. Taisei is encouraged to continue developing his academic skills throughout the second term, continue working on his communication skills, and level of self-confidence. He is also encouraged to express his opinions more often during class discussions. In the coming weeks, Taisei should dedicate some time to researching his CW1 assignment topic as well as continuous improvement of his academic English skills with the use of Mock Exams and course materials available on  Moodle."
Pink,"Taisei is a good student. He is polite in class and generally tries to concentrate. However, it is noticeable that his attention levels are dropping during the course of term 1. This is understandable since his level of skill in english make it difficult for him to understand all of the class/lecture. Taisei is generally not confident enough to contribute to class discussions and although he does try to answer when question directly his level of understanding is currently not strong enough. His formative 1 result was slightly disappointing. He therefore needs to focus on improving his language skills in order to succeed on the course. Without great improvement in these skills I am concerned that Taisei may not be successful on the course."
Amber,"Taisei - you show significant interest in the class, your score for formative -1 is 57%. You put in some good level of effort in your work and engaged in class. You need to participate more in group discussion and enhance your communication skill which will help you in your writing skill, Your performance is fine but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Amber,I believe Taisei is a very smart young man who will have no issues with progressing. His formative assignment was very good but he needs to put in just a bit more effort to guarantee a progression mark. He is in the right track however.
Amber,"Taisei has demonstrated continuous engagement with the course and the online mode of delivery. The student should now prioritise working towards improving the quality of his academic writing and presentation skills above all as these skills will be crucial in CW2 and CW3, respectively. In term 3, it is hoped that Taisei will practise all four academic English skills to prepare for summative exams. He should also study independently and transfer the skills acquired in the AES module (for instance, paraphrasing, summarising, synthesising information, referencing, etc.) to his assignments in academic subjects."
Pink,"Taisei continues to give me some concern. His level of engagement and contribution in class remains low, which appears to be due to his lack of skill in english. Whilst his summative 1 result was an improvement on his formative he needs to continue this level of improvement until the end of the course. He must ensure that he attends class regularly, take notes and be organised in his studies. 
If Taisei can focus on his studies then he has the opportunity to succeed on the course overall, but this requires energy and commitment."
Amber,"Taisei - You show significant interest in the class, your score for summative-1 is 55%. Although you put in some good level of effort in your work and are engaged in class. You need to participate more in group discussions. Your performance is fair however you need to stretch yourself further. To do this, make considerable notes during class reflect with the help of reading sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, you can improve your score significantly."
Green,Taisei has shown a lot of progress from the beginning of the year. His S1 was very good but I am certain he can do even better than that. I have marked him as green (he was on the threshold with amber) but I believe he can still improve if he continues to show the same dedication and effort in his studying.

Amber,"Ayano has done well in the first two weeks of term 2 by attending online sessions, showing continuous engagement with the course and submitting all compulsory AES tasks. She should continue working on her writing skills and take on board the feedback she has received so far. It is recommended that Ayano dedicates some time over the coming weeks to independent study using study materials available on the Moodle, Mock Exams on StudySmart and the Language Development section of the AES course book, which is likely to help her achieve her academic study goals."
Pink,"Ayano is a very good student. She concentrates well in class and is very well organised taking notes and listening attentively.  She does have some challenges with her english language skills, but there is some underlying good understanding of the topics covered on the course and this shows that with some more application she has a chance of success on the course. If Ayano continues to work hard and take the advice from her teachers I am optimistic that she can succeed on the course, but it will require a great deal of commitment."
Amber,"Ayano - You show significant interest in the class, your score for formative -1 is 60%. You need to put in some good level of effort in your work and are engaged in class. You need to participate more in group discussion and enhance your communication skill which will help you in your writing skill, Your performance is fine but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Amber,Ayano has done really good during this semester by showing excellent commitment and determination. She needs to continue with this attitude and I am certain she will progressing.
Green,"In term 2, Ayano has demonstrated a positive attitude to learning and also towards her AES assignments. The student has taken on board the feedback she has received and has been working hard to improve her results. It is hoped that, with the continuous hard work and improvement, Ayano will achieve the marks needed for progression to University. To this end, it is recommended that Ayano dedicates some time over the coming weeks to independent study and will practise for her summative exams using Mock Exams available on the WISEflow platform. She should also set some time aside to start working on her CW2 summative presentation and CW3 extended researched essay."
Amber,"Ayano remains a good student who engages fully in class and is very attentive. She appears to understand key concepts well. However her summative 1 result was disappointing. She must now carefully consider the feedback from summative 1 and apply herself to the summative 1 resit. She must also attend a tutorial to get the complete feedback. I remain hopeful that a student like Ayano will be successful on this course, but it is important that she remains committed and applies herself consistently - which she has done so far."
Amber,"Ayano - You show significant interest in the class, your score for summative is 57%. You need to put in some good level of effort in your work and are engaged in class. You need to participate more in group discussion and enhance your communication skill which will help you in your writing skill, Your performance is fine but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Amber,Ayano has done well throughout the year and she has shown a lot of improvement. Her S1 was good/very good but I am certain she is able to perform even better than this. She has shown dedication and has adapted well to online teaching. She simply needs to continue with the same determination and commitment to attain a strong progression mark.

Amber,"Although Marco demonstrates a good level of English, at times he has struggled with some of the class content, notably key concepts such as referencing and criteria of credibility. As he tries to transfer these new skills over to his written work, it is not always successful. However, more positively his reading and listening mock exam results have been overall pleasing. As we move into term 2, it is highly recommended that Marco seeks the help that is needed, otherwise he runs the risk of underperforming and not achieving his progression requirement."
Pink,"Marco has not applied himself as effectively as he could to his studies in the first term. Whilst he is able to contribute to class discussions his understanding and relevance is sometimes lacking and this is due to lack of focus and concentration on the topic. Marco is very confident about his capabilities and it is fair to say that he does appear very intelligent, but if he overestimates his own ability it will be detrimental to his studies - as he may not appreciate that he needs to work diligently in order to succeed. This is reflected in his formative 1 result which was very disappointing for a student like Marco. If he addresses his lack of application then I am optimistic that he can succeed, but he also runs the very real risk of failing the course without addressing these shortcomings."
Amber,Marco has shown good attendance in maths. He participates in the class but he needs to be more concentrated and engage with his homework. He has a good background and understanding in maths and this was reflected in his results in the assessment which was very good. Marco should continue his hard work and he will have good results in the next assessments.
Amber,"Marco -You show significant interest in the class, your score for formative -1 is 57%. You need to put in some good level of effort in your work and are engaged in class. You need to participate more in group discussion and enhance your communication skill which will help you in your writing skill, Your performance is fine but needs to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Pink,"There has been a very noticeable change in Marco's commitment to his English studies since moving to the new mode of teaching. This became a very concerning issue and has since been raised with senior academic management in regards to his continued lack of engagement  and motivation to carry out his weekly MOODLE tasks and his poor attendance at live ZOOM sessions. It can, therefore, be said that Marco really does need to take resposibility for his own learning and step up in the coming weeks and focus more on his CW1 final draft, better engage in a more timely manner with his mock exams in order to be better placed for his summatives at the end of term 2. He should also be courteous and respond to emails sent to him by his tutor."
Amber,"Marco has made some effort to improve himself since last term. His summative 1 result was significantly better and this is more in line with what I would expect from a student like Marco. However, his attendance has been a little patchy over the last few weeks and it is crucial that he maintains his focus. For example in the class this morning he was walking around during the class - he must find a quiet place to work and set aside time for both his classes and the follow up work. If Marco can improve his focus I am optimistic that he can complete his studies successfully, but there is a real risk that he will not."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Marco missed a few classes at the beginning, but then started to attend regularly and contribute to the class activities. This resulted in a very good mark of 80% in his test. Marco should continue to work in the same direction in order to progress with a very good results."
Green,"Marco - you are a pleasure to teach, you show significant interest in the class, your score for summative-1 is 80%. You have put in a good level of effort into your work compared to your formative score. It's delightful to see such significant improvement, do not lose your focus. Keep up the good work and engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources published on Moodle and in your module handbook."

Amber,"Ahmed demonstrates good listening and speaking skills and contributes well, when he is engaged and actively listening, however, his writing skills still require further improvement. He can go through the writing materials in his textbook and also teacher`s feedback over the winter break. In addition to this, reviewing term 1 material on moodle will help him perform better in term 2 and AES CW1."
Green,78% formative 1 result.  Ahmed performs well in class and this is reflected in the assessment result.  Errors are minor and can be resolved in preparation for the next assessment.
Green,Ahmed is a very smart and good student. His has shown a good attendance and interest in the class. However he should be more concentrated in the class. His report shows that he did not engage as much as it was needed. However his grade is good since he demonstrated his understanding in the topic. A bit more concentration will make Ahmed an excellent student.
Amber,"Ahmed is a good student and his attendance is good.
He has a great potential but he needs to try more in order to achieve the better results. He needs to work more on his homework and attend more in the class."
Amber,"Ahmed shows determination to learn and when he actively listens to the lesson and contributes to it, it is clear that he is interested in AES. He also participates in pair works willingly. However, he needs to make more effort to contribute to class discussions. He should do some independent study in his own time and refer to the sources available on moodle and in his AES textbook"
Green,"Ahmed had a disappointing result for his formative 2 assessment which does not reflect his capabilities.  Ahmed needs to review why he has lost marks and ensure he practises problems on these concepts.  However, Ahmed has an opportunity in term 3 to demonstrate his Decision Maths skills which will lead to a successful outcome for his course."
Pink,"Ahmed shows a good attendance in Physics. However, his interest and participation has fallen this term. He does not engage in the class and sometimes he distracts the class as well. Ahmed did a very good work for his lab report. This shows that Ahmed has a very good potential and he is a bright student. He has a clever thinking. But this is not enough for his progression. In his formative assessment he achieved 33 %. He needs to dedicate some time to study for physics and engage with homework. By solving exercises he can learn better the theory and become comfortable with calculations."
Amber,"Ahmed during this term has not shown great progress. Although he has potential and a good background in maths, he does not try to achieve his best. His attendance is not good and he does not engages with homework. Ahmed should practise more with homework and study harder for maths. Only then he can achieve a good grade in maths."

Amber,"Sarah has been a great student following her tutor`s advice since the beginning of the term, which is reflected on her formative exam positively, however her seminar discussion skills require further improvement. She can practise seminar language and critical thinking using different topics. She can also refer to moodle for reference. Reviewing term 1 materials on moodle will also help her perfom better in term 2 and AES CW1."
Green,74% formative 1 result.  Sarah has performed well in class and in this first assessment.  Errors are minor and can be resolved in preparation for the next assessment.
Green,"Sarah is a very good student with lots of interest. Her attendance was not so good this term, however she tries to catch up and not leave gaps in her studies.
There is place for improvement in her report. Keeping this attitude and this interest for improvement accompanied with higher attendance record will lead her to very good results."
Amber,Sarah has shown a great attitude in the Maths class. She is always interested and has really good questions. Her attendance was not great though. She can have a very good grade if she continues like this but improve her attendance.
Green,"Sarah shows a keen interest in learning and participates in class discussions and group work tasks. She usually completes her tasks in time successfully. Although she has got good marks in all areas, reviewing the class materials on moodle will help her in term 3. Sarah can dedicate some time to writing in her self-study time for her CW3. She can also do some extra tasks and exam practice on Moodle."
Amber,"Sarah demonstrated a good understanding of Decision Maths in term 1 but has not been as successful with the statistical unit of Applied Maths.  To understand the concepts, Sarah must engage in more independent problem solving and work towards full and punctual attendance at sessions.  Sarah has not taken advantage of the workshops for support and in term 3 she must be asking for help when she does not understand.   If Sarah makes a real effort she can still achieve a successful outcome."
Amber,"Sarah is a good student that shows always interest in the class. She is smart student, that does good questions and she is always engaging and aims to improve. Her hard work was reflected in her lab report which was very good. In the formative assessment Sarah did not perform very well. She showed that she studied, but she needs to engage with her homework more efficiently and solve more exercises to improve her grade."
Pink,"Sarah did not have good attendance during this term in Maths. This resulted on a low mark in the Maths assessment. Sarah has potential and when she attends the class, she participates and shows good progress. However, she should attend more often, and when this is not possible, she should check the moodle page or contact the tutor  for advice on what to study for the topic that she has missed. She needs hard work to ensure her progression. If she follows this advice, she can have good results in her assessments."

Pink,"Although Hamza has demonstrated a reasonable level of English language skills, he has struggled with academic English in general and also with some of the class content, notably key concepts such as referencing and criteria of credibility. This has been reflected in his classwork and homework and thus he is under performing. Similarly, his mock exam results have also been disappointing. As we move into term 2, it is highly recommended that he seeks the help that is needed, otherwise he is jeopardising his chances of progression."
Green,"Hamza is a very confident student, but at times he lacks the application required to be a successful student. Although he contributes to class discussions in a positive way he often finds it difficult to concentrate and this is partly due to his lack of note taking. These are skills that he will need to develop in order to succeed. His formative 1 work was good, but to maintain this level of mark he needs to become more organised and serious about his work."
Pink,"Hamza has shown good attendance in the class. He is a smart student that can achieve a good score in maths. However during the class he does not concentrate, he distracts the class and he does not hold himself to higher standards. He should work more on this homework and make a priority of the maths practise. Thus, he can ensure his progression."
Amber,"Hamza - You show significant interest in the class, your score for formative -1 is 64%. You need to put in some good level of effort in your work and are engaged in class. You need to participate more in group discussion and enhance your communication skill which will help you in your writing skill, Your performance is fine but needs to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Pink,"There has been a very noticeable change in Hamza's commitment to his English studies since moving to the new mode of teaching. This became a very concerning issue and has since been raised with senior academic management in regards to his continued lack of engagement  and motivation to carry out his weekly MOODLE tasks and his poor attendance at live ZOOM sessions. It can, therefore, be said that Hamza really does need to take resposibility for his own learning and step up in the coming weeks and focus more on his CW1 final draft, better engage in a more timely manner with his mock exams in order to be better placed for his summatives at the end of term 2. He should also be courteous and respond to emails sent to him by his tutor."
Pink,"Hamza is a potentially good student as he has a reasonably good level of english and some intelligence, but he is not applying himself to his studies. It is very concerning that he did not submit his summative 1 assignment as this is a very bad sign for future performance. He has also reduced his attendance and energy in class since the transfer to online classes. I am now quite concerned about Hamza's ability to pass the course."
Amber,These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Hamza missed many on-line classes. His test result of 76% was quite good. It is very important for Hamza to start to attend the classes regularly as statistics is a very challenging subject. He should work on this homework and submit it for feedback.
Amber,"Hamza - You show significant interest in the class, your score for summative -1 is 56%. Your need to improve your concentration level you can get distracted easily. You need to put in a lot of hard work to reach your progression requirements. Your performance is fair but needs to stretch yourself. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."

Green,"Yi is a hard-working, dedicated and respectful student who takes care to participate fully in all class activities. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented him and his classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, Yi’s performance in the mock assessments throughout the term indicates he has a  good understanding of the concepts taught in the AES module so far. That said, Yi needs to continue working on his academic writing, including syntax and paraphrasing, in order to improve his chances of scoring high marks in summative AES assessments. Provided he does this, I am confident that Yi will meet his progression requirements."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment. Patrick understanding of the material is very good. His test result was 82%. Sometimes Patrick does mistakes because of misunderstanding of the questions asked, so there is a scope for improvement in the area of English Maths terminology. He also should try to present his work properly and clearly. I am sure he has potential to achieve the highest results."
Pink,Yi has shown an excellent attendance in the class. He participates in the class and engages with the questions asked during the class. However his report was weak and it needs improvement. This is the reason that Yi takes the pink mark. He has potential to get a much better grade but he needs to increase his effort and achieve a better mark. If Yi improves his engagement with his report and his homework he will have better results.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment (88%). Patrick's Maths level is very good. He is working regularly in class and at home. To achieve even better results Patrick needs to understand that it is necessary to present his mathematical work to others properly and clearly. 
I suggest to send me regularly a piece of homework for the comments about the presentation."
Green,"Yi Pan demonstrates good skills in all areas. He attends live sessions regularly and makes interesting contributions to discussions. He also participates fully in all group and pair activities. While his speaking, reading and listening skills are very good, he can benefit from practising his writings skills. He can refer to Moodle, especially for timed writing and organisation skills. He can also work on his paraphrasing skills, which will be required for CW3."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the second formative assessment. Patrick is a very strong student and his understanding of the material is very good. Unfortunately he is under-performing in the tests because he is not paying attention to the questions asked, he does not present his work properly and clearly and he is leaving the submissions till the last moments, so he has no time to check his work. His test result was 80%, but he can do much better."
Amber,"Yi is a good student in Physics and he participates in the class. He attends and he is interested. I would encourage Yi to improve his speaking skills and do not hesitate to talk during the class.  Yi has improved since the start of the year, but there is still place for improvement. This is important for Yi in order to show his good understanding in physics, especially for his oral presentation of his poster in the Summative 2."
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Patrick has a very good understanding of the material, but he is seriously under-performing in his tests (66% in the last one). The reason is that he is not presenting his mathematical work properly and clearly, does not answer the questions in full. He also leaves the submissions till the last moment, so he has no time to check his work. This problem is getting worse and could potentially lead to a disaster. He needs to work hard now in order to get much  better result in his second summative assessment. I recommend to start with the homework; he should aim to submit it in time."

Pink,"Dennis is a considerate and polite student who consistently demonstrates respect and consideration for his peers and tutors. He is an active participant in group learning activities. He usually investigates and obtains information independently. Dennis has expressed an eagerness to do better in his academic studies and, over the duration of Term 1, he made some improvement in his overall academic performance. Dennis is encouraged to participate more frequently in class discussions and share his findings on the class forum. He should continue to practise listening to improve his listening and note-taking skills. He should also keep working on his paraphrasing and referencing skills. It is recommended that Dennis dedicates a considerable amount of time to researching his CW1 in term 2."
Amber,"Zhenyu is a good student who takes his studies seriously. At times he finds it difficult to concentrate in class, but on the whole he is focussed on his studies. He is able to answer questions in class when asked directly, but still finds it difficult to participate in wider discussions - which is an important skill for developing his understanding. Zhenyu's biggest challenge is to develop his skill in english and if he is able to do this I am optimistic about his chances of overall success on the course."
Amber,"Wang(Dennis) -  Your pleasure to teach, you show significant interest in the class participates in group discussions, your score for formative -1 is 60%. Your performance is good but needs to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Amber,"Dennis is trying really hard to improve on his English and is showing excellent commitment. While his formative grade was in the range of 50's, if he continues with a similar commitment he will be able to take his grade up to the 60's. Dennis needs to continue with the same commitment and determination he has shown until now if he is to gain a progression mark."
Amber,Dennis has made some improvement in his overall academic performance in term 2. The student has engaged well with the AES module and the online delivery mode. This allowed him to stay on top of his assignments and meet the requirements of the module. Dennis should continue to practise academic skills using the mock exams available to students on the WISEflow platform. He should also keep working on his paraphrasing and referencing skills. It is recommended that Dennis sets some time aside to start preparing for his CW2 summative presentation and CW3 extended researched essay.
Amber,"Zhenyu is a good student. He is interested and engaged in class although his english language skills remain a little too low to allow him to be fully involved in the class. He should address this by focussing on improving his skill in english. His summative 1 result showed some promise and he now needs to work on the feedback from that work to improve the resit result to the necessary level. it will be hard for Zhenyu to make this progress, but it is certainly possible with the right level of commitment and attitude. He must continue to take feedback and guidance and if he does he has a chance of succeeding on the course."
Amber,"Wang(Dennis) - Your pleasure to teach, you show significant interest in the class participates in group discussions, your score for summative -1 is 60%. Your performance is good but needs to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. To do this, make considerable notes in class which will help you to improve writing skills and please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting these efforts you can improve your score significantly."
Green,Dennis has made immense progress from the start of the year. He has had issues with his English proficiency but his determination and commitment in learning has shown that he is able to perform and progress. His S1 Wwas very good and allows him to continue his efforts towards progression. He should continue with the same determination and commitment as he is more than able to progress.

Green,"You have worked hard in Arts this term and it has shown with a strong Formative Assignment mark, which has set you up very well for your Summative Assignment - well done. However, you are normally very quiet in class, though contributions that you make in group work are both valuable and pertinent. Try and contribute a bit more to class discussions as this, along with your hard work in Arts, would set you on a path to success."
Amber,"Yue is a mild-mannered and very polite student. Her language level poses some challenge to her succeeding, but aside from this she shows a good grasp of how to use visual material to convey a narrative or message. For this reason I have faith that Yue could do very well in this subject indeed. My advice would be for Yue to spend as much time as she can absorbing good vocabulary and writing style from model answers and academic sources."
Green,"Yue's formative assignment was very good, with a mark of 64. She seems to generally be understanding the content, despite being very quiet during class. She could improve on her participation in class, which will show me that she has a good understanding of the subject."
Pink,Chen has sadly withdrawn from the IFY programme.

Amber,"Zehao has managed to engage with the online learning mode to some extent and he has submitted some of the compulsory AES tasks so far. He should take on board all the feedback he has received on the tasks he submitted and act on the comments in order to make improvements to the quality of his academic work. Establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of Zehao's main goals. Over the next two terms, Zehao should continue to work on improving his academic English skills with the use of Mock Exams on StudySmart as well as independent study materials available on Moodle."
Green,"You have done well in your Formative Assignment - so well done. Therefore, you have a solid foundation for your Summative Assignment, which is good to see. You have clearly worked hard in Arts, and this is most evident in group work. However, it would be good to hear more from you in general discussion, where you are very quiet. You should aim to participate more as it will help you develop over the rest of the course."
Amber,"Carl is an active student and important member of our class. His language level poses a significant challenge to his completing this course successfully, but aside from this he shows some grasp of how visual material is used to convey a narrative or message. For this reason I have some faith that Carl may do better than expected in this subject, but my strong advice would be for him to spend as much time as he can absorbing good vocabulary and writing style from model answers and academic sources."
Pink,Carl has been quiet in class. he does not contribute as much as he can in class. His formative was not that good either.
Amber,"In term 2, Zehao has managed to maintain a good level of engagement with the AES course and the online learning mode. The student attended his CW1 tutorial and has demonstrated a positive attitude towards his coursework. Although a substantial amount of improvement to the quality of his academic work is still needed, the crucial thing is that Zehao keeps up the hard work throughout term 3. Therefore, the student should continue to work on improving his academic English skills with the use of Mock Exams on the WISEflow platform and start working towards his CW2 presentation and CW3 extended research essay."
Green,"Well done: your result in Arts for Summative 1 was very good. You have been working hard and this is good to see. However, it would be nice to see a little more evidence of this work in class. Sometimes you participate well in class, but it would be good to see you make that a more consistent effort. As we go forward try and develop those skills as they will help you with your Formative 2 and ultimately your Summative 2. At the moment you should be pleased, but carry on developing this in order to continue this success."
Amber,"Carl is an able student who should do well, but unfortunately his summative 1 results were poorer than expected. Carl has chosen to resit s1 and this is a good decision. Carl needs to work harder though to understand what s1 and summative 2 are asking of students and to really showcase this in clear ways to pick up marks. He need to continue attending class and making thorough notes. Also, I would advise him to study the model answers for s1 and s2 closely to try and grasp why these answers have been awarded the marks they have."
Green,Carl has performed very well in his S1 with a very good mark. He has shown dedication in studying and learning online and has been able to adjust well. He should continue with the same commitment and I have no doubt he will be able to progress.

Pink,"Kewei has found it challenging to engage with the course or complete the compulsory AES tasks in the first two weeks of term 2. Therefore, establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of his main goals. Kewei should attend the virtual office hours and try to catch up on what has been covered so far. It is recommended that Kewei familiarises himself with the online learning mode, starts using study materials available on Moodle, which is likely to improve his chances of progression."
Green,"Your Formative Assignment in Arts was very good - well done. This is a good foundation for your Summative Assignment in a few weeks' time. You have clearly worked hard in Arts this term and it is now paying off. However, there are times when you need to focus more in class - and it would be good to hear more from you in class discussions, as you are often very quiet, though you work well in groups. With the transition to online learning, you are going to need to take responsibility for  being more articulate in the classroom."
Amber,"Andy is a mild-mannered and very polite student. His language level poses significant challenge to him completing this course successfully, but aside from this he shows some grasp of how visual material is used to convey a narrative or message. For this reason I have some faith that Andy may do well in this subject, but my strong advice would be for Andy to spend as much time as he can absorbing good vocabulary and writing style from model answers and academic sources."
Amber,"Kewei had a good formative assignment, with a mark in the range of 55. His performance in class is not that good, as he rarely, if ever, talks during seminars. He always sits in the back and never contributes to the discussion. He needs to improve on these attributes, which speak to his English language proficiency, in order to have a chance at progressing."
Pink,"Initially, Kewei's level of engagement with the online study mode in term 2 has been questionable. However, there has been some improvement in the past couple of weeks and it is hoped that the student will be successful in maintaining this positive trend throughout the remainder of the IFY programme. It is recommended that the student attends the VOH, asks his AES tutors any questions he might have and works hard to catch up with the course. Kewei is likely to do well on the condition that he engages well with the programme and his participation level improves in term 3."
Amber,"We have spoken at length about your Summative 1 mark and the need for you to improve this if you wish to progress. We have also spoken about potential strategies for you to start to participate in class. Ultimately, you are a capable student in Arts, but you do need to start working hard, engaging with the materials and classes. At the moment, you are very quiet - and this is having a problematic effect on your performance. However, if you start attending workshops as requested and engaging more fully with classes, this should have a good effect. You can do it!"
Green,"A surprisingly strong summative 1 results has shown Andy to be a student who has the capacity to do well in this subject. Andy has shown a good level of understanding and some critical thinking in his assessment and needs now to build on this in order to achieve a similarly high grade in his summative 2. Attendance of all classes (regularly scheduled classes and additional classes to support students completing s2) is essential. My advice to Andy at this stage would be to make a clear plan of how he will tackle the four components of s2 and begin his research on his chosen form, brief and issue and debate."
Amber,"Andy seemed to be facing issues with his English proficiency at the beginning of the course, but since then he has improved a lot. He has asked for help where he needed and he seems to be committed and determined at progressing. I am sure he will be progress for certain if he continues with the same dedication to improve."

Green,"Ayan is a real pleasure to have in class. Bright, intelligent and highly-driven, he is not afraid to question concepts taught in the AES module to further his learning and deepen his understanding of the principles of academic English. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented Ayan  and his classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, his performance in the mock assessments throughout the term indicates he has a very firm grasp on the principles of Academic English and can employ a range of appropriate exam strategies to his academic advantage. Provided he continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity in Terms 2 and 3, I am confident that Ayan’s summative results will be of an equally high standard."
Amber,"Your work in class has been excellent: you make pertinent and insightful contributions to class discussions and work well in groups. However, you have not submitted a Formative Assignment or contacted me for a tutorial, which is far more problematic, and makes it hard to judge your progress in a concrete sense. Thus, it is a mixed picture from Arts. In order to ensure progression, you need to take all parts of the module seriously - and work as hard on them as you do in class."
Pink,"Ayan is an able student but his failure to attend classes regularly; take notes diligently and to show the discipline needed for his studies will ultimately undermine his chances of progressing on to his chosen degree. This would of course be a real shame, as Ayan is more than capable of proceeding to studying at UG level. It is merely his approach and attitude that is letting him down."
Green,"Ayan is a boy with a very critical eye and thinking, who is very likely to progress. His formative was very good, attaining a 70 mark. His comments and discussion are always very critical and always backed up with valid arguments. However, he needs however to consider being less complacent and more modest in relation to his colleagues."
Green,"Ayan is a bright and active student, who shows keen interest in learning and attends live sessions regularly. He always participates in pair work tasks and class discussions enthusiastically. While his reading, listening and speaking skills are quite good, he would benefit from practising his writing skills. He follows his tutor`s advice carefully, especially on writing. However, he still needs to improve his research skills and evaluate his sources more effectively. He can refer to Moodle for some extra materials"
Pink,"We have spoken at length about the fact that you are a student with a lot of potential, but that you are currently underperforming in Arts. Your attendance has been problematic, and your Summative 1 was disappointing for a student of your ability. However, I know that you plan to resit and we now have a plan in place - so hopefully this will enable you to be much more successful with your second attempt. This is very much in your hands as when you are in lessons and engage you are a capable student, showing that you think about texts and interrogate them well. More of that please - and hopefully onwards and upwards!"
Green,"Ayan did well in his summative 1 assessment, but under performed in terms of his potential. Ayan should be at the top of the class but fails to be there because of his lack of commitment. Ayan's attendance of my classes is not good and his failure to attend tutorials has also led to him and I having very serious words about his attitude and not meeting basic expectations. Ayan has the full potential to do well in this subject. My advice to him would be to engage with all classes and sessions organised to support students completing summative 2. He needs to work harder to showcase his creativity and imagination. Leaving the portfolio until the last minute is going to prove fatal and so planning how he will execute this piece of work is essential to doing well."
Green,"Ayan is a brilliant young man, with a very critical mind (despite our ideological disagreements). He is always able to justify his claims and present evidence for every comment he makes. He has a lot of potential in his academic career and with an appropriate level of commitment he can achieve a lot."

Amber,"Damon consistently participates in class and group activities. He continues to demonstrate a keen interest in learning and works well independently as well as with others. Damon usually investigates a given topic and obtains information independently, and does well in terms of sharing his findings in front of the class. However, his listening skills need further development. What is more, he should continue working on his writing skills and take on board the feedback he has received so far. Damon should dedicate some time during his winter break to researching his CW1 in order to give himself a head start on researching the topic in Term 2."
Amber,"Damon is a quiet student who seems to be working steadily. There are times when I am not sure if he is fully engaged in class and there are some basic concepts where he lacks understanding. His first assignment was encouraging, but this is still not at the standard required to progress so he will need to increase his effort to engage in class and take on board the feedback from the first assignment."
Green,64% formative 1 result.  Damon has done well in this first assessment.  There have been some difficult concepts but attention to detail has led to this achievement.
Amber,"Your participation is good in class. You demonstrate some understanding of the subject. You have put in a good level of effort into your work. Your score is 63% to keep up your work, Usually, you an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions. Do keep the considerable effort in making notes on paper, your aim should be to improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Amber,"Damon is responsive to feedback and builds positive relationships with his peers and tutors. He achieved a score of 46% in the last writing mock exam and has made noticeable progress in terms of his reading and research skills, as demonstrated in CW1 where he was awarded a mark of 71%. However, his listening skills need further development as he scores on average approx. 40% in AES listening mock exams. Damon should continue to work on improving his writing, listening and note-taking skills throughout term 3 with the use of Mock Exams as well as independent study tasks available on the Moodle every week."
Amber,"Damon has been steadily improving during term 1 and 2. He still finds some concepts tricky and his english skill could improve further, but overall he appears to be making progress. He will have to maintain his focus and energy in order to succeed, but if he does that there is still a chance for him to make it."
Green,Summative 1 result 52%.  Damon has been working hard to prepare for his summative 1 resit.  He works quietly and independently and this will support a grade more indicative of his formative 1 result.  Damon now needs to concentrate on the statistics component to ensure understanding of these concepts prior to summative 2.
Amber,"Damon - You have attended most of my classes this term and always an active participant in class discussions, asking helpful questions. I do find though that at times you get distracted in class, and this may be something for you to work on. Your summative -1 score was 68%, which is very good. You should now engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."

Amber,"Gun has a high level of speaking skills, which definitely helps him be more active in group work and class discussions; 
however, he needs to improve his seminar skills and go through the appropriate academic language, which was covered in the textbook before. In addition to this, his writing skills require improvement as well, especially in terms of content and referencing. Reviewing term 1 materials on moodle will help him perform better on term 2 and AES CW2."
Amber,"Gun has one of the highest standards of language capability in the group and this should give him an opportunity to perform well. However, he does not have the necessary energy and motivation. He does not participate in class discussions unless asked directly and does not always have a grasp of the key concepts. His first assignment result was acceptable, but there is an opportunity for him to do much better if he commits to his studies with more energy."
Amber,"You demonstrate some command of the subject Your score is 62%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class. Usually, an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions. You need to focus a little more in class. You need to make notes in class, please improve your concentration level in class, you can be easily distracted as you come with prior knowledge of the subject, your performance can be strong, but need to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Amber,"Gun is young man with lots of potential if he takes University seriously.

He is still very chilled in terms of his studying and has not engaged seriously with his studies. 

He has lots of potential and capabilities and would hate to see them go to waste because of his attitude."
Amber,"Gun has a good level of English and shows interest in improving his Academic Engklish skills but he needs to make more effort and to contribute to class discussions actively. His reading and listening skills have improved significantly since the beginning of the term, however, his writing skills require further improvement. It is important that he engages in independent study using the resources available to him on Moodle and in his AES textbook."
Amber,"Gun remains generally passive about his studies. There is low energy and low motivation to succeed. As a result, his understanding is weaker than it could be and his level of skill is not increasing. His summative result was just about acceptable, but he is running the risk of failing the course overall if he does not apply himself to his studies."
Amber,"Gun - You demonstrate some understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  66% Your results in assessments have been fair so far. Improve your concentration level. You should be more focused work hard to your potential, use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle"
Amber,Gun has excellent communication skills but he has been lazy throughout the year and has not shown the adequate determination and commitment. His S1 was good (60) but he needs to improve considerably on both his commitment and determination if he is to progress at University.

Amber,"In the first instance, Alisa needs to show greater commitment and engagement to her AES module and be less distracted by the content on her mobile phone. Her class performance so far does not reflect the essential academic skills that have been covered in term 1; but in the last week she has made a concerted effort to catch-up by doing some writing practices. Alisa has a good level of English and I believe that by showing more commitment she will do well in her future academic studies. The area that she needs to focus on are her academic writing skills, and she can seek further support from drop-in clinics."
Amber,"Alisa is a good student, but she is lacking in classroom focus. She is easily distracted and this reduces her ability to learn and develop. She has recently begun to participate more in class discussions, but she still remains less engaged than some other students. Her first assignment shows some requirement to improve although if she listens to the feedback and increases her level of focus she is very likely to improve a great deal."
Amber,"You demonstrate some understanding of the subject Your score is 57%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class. Usually, you not an active participant in class discussions Need to focus a little more in class. You need to make notes in class, please improve your concentration level in class, your performance can be better your aim should be to improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Amber,"Alisa's level of attendance is something she should look to improve, along with the use of her mobile phone. She is not a child and as an adult should take responsibility for her own learning and actions. 

Participation has been somewhat satisfactory but there is a lot of room for improvement. 

Her overall learning has been a bit patchy and inconsistent. It is a pitty as she does not realise the potential that she has. Her assessment proves this inconsistency in terms of learning."
Amber,"Alisa's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have been overall satisfactory. Her term 1 exam results have highlighted that her writing skills are much weaker than her other skills. However, it must be pointed out that over term 2 there has been an improvement in Alisa's approach to her English studies and as a result not only has her writing improved but also her reading. Her CW1 grade was good, and I hope that in term 3 she will show the same commitment to CW2 and CW3 because I am confident that by focusing and being committed and seeking help when needed with exams and assignments, she will succeed on the IFY."
Green,"Alisa continues to have some attention in issues in class, however she put a great deal of energy and effort into her most recent assessment and it was a very good piece of work. She was open to guidance and feedback and this meant that her assessed work improved dramatically. Whilst I am optimistic for Alisa's overall success it is a shame if she only applies herself to assessments and does not take the opportunity to develop herself in a wider sense."
Amber,"Alisa - You demonstrate good understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  72 % Your results in assessments is commendable. Improve your concentration level. You should be more focused, work to your potential, use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook, moodle."
Amber,"Alisa had constant issues with her level of attention during class and her use of mobile phone. 

Her s1 was in the range of 60 and she did do a resit which was however not better. 

She needs to work much more for her S2 as her formative was really bad. The result shows that perhaps she did not understand what is expected of the research report the two times I explained it in class. Again this is connected with her attention in class throughout this year."

Amber,"Ali is a hard-working and conscientious student, and this has been reflected in his class performance. He possesses a good level of English, but one aspect that he needs to keep working on is his academic writing skills which he initially struggled with in class. He needs to be more receptive to the written feedback and review the class notes on academic writing. By doing so will mean that he will be able to improve on his written assignments. He can seek further support from drop-in clinics where he can ask questions and get some useful advice."
Amber,"Ali is an excellent student who is always very engaged in class. He is always offering answers to questions and these answers often have a great deal of insight and understanding of the key concepts.
His first assignment results are a little disappointing, but I think if he works on the feedback I expect future assignment results to be much better. Overall Ali is likely to do very well on this course."
Green,"Ali consistently participates actively in class and makes a valuable contribution to class discussions and work-pair work. He is a conscientious student, he prepares his homework and this is reflected in his performance in exams. His attendance is excellent as well."
Green,"You demonstrate some command of the subject. Your score is 66%. You put in a good level of effort in your work but need to be better engaged in class at times. Usually, you are an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions, but you need to focus a little more too. Your performance is strong but you need to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,"Ali's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have been very positive. His term 1 exam results have highlighted his key strengths are his reading, listening and writing, and similarly his CW1 grade was very pleasing. While he performed slightly less well in his speaking, with this skill more preparation and practice will improve his performance. For Term 3 I believe that Ali will continue to remain focused and committed to his English studies and as such I am confident that he will succeed on the IFY."
Green,Ali continues to be a very committed student. He is clearly very intelligent and is able to grasp new concepts easily. His ability to articulate arguments and ask intelligent questions is very good and I fully expect him to succeed in his studies. His summative 1 result was reflective of his capabilities and he will increase these marks in the future as his skills grow.
Green,"Ali is an excellent student. His attendance is great. He is always interested in the class, he participates and he engages with his homework. Ali should continue like this and he will have great results in the final exams."
Green,"Ali - You are a pleasure to teach, are active in class and do participate in the class discussions too. Your summative-1 score is 69%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong but you need to stretch yourself further. Try to concentrate more on subject-specific terminology in the topics taught; please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and Moodle page."

Amber,"Anqi is a hard-working and conscientious student, and this has been reflected in her class performance. Her listening score has improved, but it is a skill that needs to be continuously worked on. She has demonstrated a critical approach to tasks in class and has a good understanding of the required skills, and thus she is making efforts to implement these skills into her classwork and assessments. She acts upon feedback which has seen her performance improve, and she can seek further support from drop-in clinics."
Green,"You have worked very hard this term in Arts and it has paid off. Your assignment mark was very good - so well done. This gives you a very strong foundation for your work next term. You have also really developed as a student and gained in confidence which has been lovely to see. At the start of the year, you were much more nervous about class participation, but this has really developed so well done. You should aim to carry on like this and contribute even more so that you can develop further."
Green,Angel is an able student whom I see as doing even better than she already has as her confidence grows. Her attendance has been very good and she has shown a good understanding of this subject. Angel should now concentrate on revising her notes and raising the sophistication of her interpretations by working on her written communication. A delight to have in the classroom.
Amber,"Angel's level of attendance has been excellent and so has her participation in class.

She seems to have taken a liking in Sociology and this is reflected in the efforts she puts in.

Her assessment was quite good but I believe she will be able to much improve on that during the New Year."
Amber,"Anqi's formative exam results in Term 1 and result for her summative CW1 have been mixed. The key skills that she needs to improve on are her speaking, listening and writing which are below threshold requirements. However, she should not be discouraged because over term 2 there has been a noticeable improvement. For speaking, more careful preparation and confidence will help boost her performance, while her listening and writing skills could be improved by simply practising and getting feedback from her tutor. A particular mention should be made about her CW1 result in which she scored above 90% and this is owing to her commitment to her AES studies. For Term 3 she should continue to strive for the best and to ask any questions to support her AES exams and assignments. I am confident that she will succeed on the IFY."
Green,"You have worked very hard in Arts and you have good marks to show for it - well done. Your Summative mark going forward is a good one and your Formative 2 was also good, showing that you have the capability to do well in Summative 2. As we move to online learning, you need to think about how you are going to maintain participating in class discussions as you are often quiet: you will need to try and ensure that you keep up the habit of contributing. Meanwhile, carry on reading primary and secondary literature with an eye on Summative 2."
Green,"Angel is a wonderful student with great potential. She has demonstrated great commitment to her studies and is an active member of our class. Despite joining our class later, she has performed very well indeed. I am confident that Angel will do very well and needs only to work a little harder on her written English, something she ran into trouble with in her early formative assessments. Nonetheless, I have full faith in her capability and believe she will perform strongly in the final assessment a few weeks from now."
Green,Angel is more than able to attain a progression mark. She has shown an interest in Sociology and despite a glitch in the submission process her first summative was very good at 70. Her resit was in the range of 64 which is very very close to a progression mark.

Amber,"Suki demonstrates good English language skills and contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. She listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as part of a group. She is also fully focused on the content and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Her writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,Shuqi is a very good student. She is engaged in class and can answer questions confidently when asked. Her first assignment result was very good and if she accepts the feedback this will only improve. Based on this strong start I am very hopeful that Shuqi will have a successful foundation year.
Amber,"You have some fair knowledge of the topics that have been covered in class, you demonstrate some understanding of the subject, and you need to actively participate in the class discussion. Your score is 61%, need to use your potential to the maximum, considerable amount of notes is made by you in class, please put that into good use, while writing assignment make a flow chart with the notes written by you, revise material posted in Moodle you can progress your score further."
Amber,"Shuqi's level of attendance has been very good, the same with her level of participation in class. 

She seems to be putting a very good level of effort in her studies and she can push on that a bit more. Her assessment was good but she has the capabilities to improve much more on that."
Amber,"Suki demonstrates good speaking skills and contributes, when present, to all class discussions. Suki has achieved above 50% in overall grades, which is slightly lower than the overall English language requirement for her chosen degree. She is particularly struggling with her academic writing skills and therefore needs to work harder to improve on them. Attending virtual office hours and doing extra writing tasks on Moodle are recommended to improve her chances of progression."
Amber,"Shuqi is a good student, but she has lost a little focus during the most recent term. This is a shame as she must work hard in order to succeed. In particular, Shuqi's lack of work on formative 2 was very disappointing and a missed opportunity for her to grow her skill and knowledge. This is all the more disappointing because she has some talent that could be developed very well."
Amber,"Shuqi - You are a pleasure to teach, You have a good command of the subject. It is clearly shown in your summative resit score which is 65%. You put in a commendable level of effort in the work at times you are slightly disturbed in class. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. Try to revise  topics taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle page"
Green,I believe Shuqi has improved a lot during this year. Her level of English language has improved and her participation and ability to evaluate topics was improved as well. I am really pleased with Shuqi's commitment.

Green,"Ka ming demonstrates good reading, writing, speaking and listening skills, however, he can still benefit from reviewing the writing materials on  moodle and in his textbook to get better in referencing and sources. Also, Ka ming should dedicate sometime to research so that he can have a head start for his CW before the term starts. Finding the suitable sources and checking their credibility are first steps that he should follow."
Amber,"Alan is a very positive student who participates in class and is able to answer questions well with a good grasp of the concepts. At times he can get distracted, but this is not bad overall. His first assignment result was very good (which reflects his classroom performance) and I expect Alan to succeed on this course if he maintains his energy and commitment."
Green,98% formative 1 result.  Alan is a capable mathematician for whom this first term's work has not been difficult.  He now needs to be prepared for the statistics module which has a different focus.
Green,"You show some command of the subject. This is clearly shown in your score, which is 68%. Some good level of effort is put in your work. You need to be better engaged in class and to focus a little more in class. Your performance is strong but you need to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,"Ka Ming is a student who shows keen interest in learning and attends the classes regularly. He usually participates in pair work tasks and class discussions. However, reviewing the materials which were used to cover essay writing will help him perfom better in CW3. In addition to this, Ka Ming can do some extra exam practice, which can be found on Moodle."
Green,"Alan is a very good student and achieved a very high mark in his summative 1 assessment. He is able to grasp new concepts very rapidly and apply strong critical reasoning to this knowledge. Whilst he is doing very well he has an opportunity to improve his confidence in classroom discussions and develop his skill in forming arguments to support his points. Overall, I am very optimistic about his prospects of success on the course."
Amber,Summative 1 result 37%.  Summative 1 results were somewhat disappointing and a surprise for Alan.  Alan is capable of so much more but he needs to refocus in class and engage more with independent problem solving.  He has an opportunity to demonstrate his true ability in the resit and this must not go to waste.  Alan must now concentrate on the statistics concepts and seek help when he needs it.  I am expecting Alan to show his real ability in the next two assessments.
Green,"Au ka Ming - You have a good command of the subject. It is clearly shown in your summative resit score which is 80%. You put in a commendable level of effort in the work though at times you are slightly distracted in class. Your performance is certainly strong but you need to be more consistent as this strong outcome was the result of a resit and you should aim to do as well as you can in your first sit. Try to revise topics taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and Moodle page."

Green,"I am very pleased with Enkhlkham's attitude and the progress he has made in the AES course. She is fully focused on the content and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She has also handed in all of her homework on time and completed all tasks to a high standard. Enkhlkham has achieved above 60% in overall grades, which is above the English language requirement for her chosen degree and it is a good result for this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!"
Amber,"Enkhikham is a very good student. She is very attentive in class and tries to involve herself in class discussions. She has a good understanding of the key concepts and uses this well in class.
Her first assignment result was very good and I am very hopeful that she will succeed on the course if she maintains her level of energy and motivation."
Green,Enkhlkham is a very good student. She puts a commendable level of effort into her work. Her level of attendance is excellent.  Her participation in the class is very good but there is some space for improvement.  She prepares her homework and her hard work is shown in her exam results.

She needs to work hard to improve her academic writing skills. Attending virtual office hours and doing extra writing tasks  on Moodle are recommended to improve his chances of progression."
Green,Enkhikham is a very talented student who is beginning to develop her confidence. Her summative 1 result was excellent and this is a very good indicator for the future as she continues to grow her knowledge and skill. Her work in the group exercise was good and I have the expectation that she will continue to succeed on the course going forward.
Green,Enkhlkham has great attendance. She is always keen on understanding and solving the problems in Maths. She engages with the homework and she participates in the class. If Enkhlkham continues like this till the end of the term she is going to have great results in her final exams.
Green,"Bold - You have a good command of the subject. It is clearly shown in your summative resit score which is 65%.

His seminar, reading and listening skills are quite high, however, his writing skills still require  further development. Reviewing the materials which were used to cover essay writing will help him perfom better in term 2. In addition to this, Omar can start his research for his CW1 over the winter break to have a head start."
Amber,"Omar is generally a good student. He participates well in class, he is able to answer questions well and he is normally engaged in the class. His first assignment result was disappointing and he needs to listen carefully to the feedback. However, I am overall optimistic about Omar's prospects of success on the course. Omar must also commit to being consistently attentive in class."
Green,"88% formative 1 result.  Omar has a good attitude to his work and has paid attention to problems, asking for support where needed.  This is reflected in his first assessment result."
Amber,"You demonstrate some command of the subject. Your score is 64%. You put in some good level of effort in your work, but at times you need to be better engaged in class. You ask useful questions but need to focus a little more and make notes in class. Please improve your concentration level in class because you can be easily distracted. Because you come with prior knowledge of the subject, your performance can be even stronger and I feel you need to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Amber,"Omar demonstrates good listening and speaking skills and contributes well, when he is engaged and actively listening, however, his writing skills still require further improvement. He can go through the writing materials in his textbook and also teacher`s feedback in his own time. In addition to this, reviewing term 1 and 2  materials on moodle will help him perform better in term 3 and AES CW2 and CW3."
Green,Omar is a good student and generally participates well in class. His assignment result was good and if he can increase his focus and energy on the course I believe that he is capable of better results in the future. From time to time he can lose focus in class and he needs to be careful that he consistently maintains attention to his studies to ensure he completes the course successfully.
Green,Summative 1 result 85%.  Omar has achieved consistently excellent grades in his pure maths component and now he needs to demonstrate the same high level result in the statistics component ensuring he understands the specialist terminology. Omar engages fully in class activities and independent problem solving and supports his peers.  Well done Omar.
Amber,"Omar - You have attended most of my classes this term. You are usually an active participant in class discussions and ask questions, but at times you get distracted in the class. Nonetheless, I do believe you are putting in considerable effort outside of class and your summative -1 score demonstrates this 63%. Your knowledge and understanding of the topics however, can be broadened further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."

Green,"Ryan possesses strong English skills and has demonstrated a good understanding of the key academic skills required to succeed in his academic studies. This has been transferred to his writing and speaking assessments; and this has been demonstrated in his formative results which are pleasing. I believe he will do very well in his academic studies. One aspect that he should continually work on is his writing which although good, could be improved upon by using more academic vocabulary."
Amber,"Ryan is a good student. He is able to understand key concepts, but does not normally participate in class discussions. If he is asked questions directly he gives good answers which show his good understanding. His first assignment result was a little disappointing so he must now listen carefully to the feedback and apply this learning going forward."
Amber,Ryan is a very good student and his attendance is excellent. However the last period his performance is not in line with his potential. He should participate more in the class and ask more questions. His results in assessments have not been the best that he can. Ryan needs to work harder and he will ensure his progression.
Amber,"You demonstrate some command of the subject Your score is 62%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class.

Amber,"Hang Yan's formative exams in Term 1 and CW1 summative assessment for Term 2 have been overall positive. His term 1 exam results have highlighted that his key strengths are his reading and listening, while he performed less well in his speaking and writing. However, over the course of term 2 I have noticed an improvement in these 2 skills, and so by dedicating more time to practising these skills he will see improved results. For Term 3 I believe that by focusing and remaining committed and seeking help when needed with exams and assignments, I am confident that he will succeed on the IFY."
Amber,"Ryan is a good student in general. He has had some issues with focus and attention in class during term 2, but his assessment result was good. Although his standard of english could be improved he is sufficiently proficient to make good progress on the course. Ryan's key issue now is to maintain focus and energy on the course and if he is able to do that I am optimistic that he will succeed overall."
Amber,"Ryan has shown good attendance in the class. He is a good student, with a good Maths background and great potential. However, Ryan does not engage with his homework. His participation in class is satisfactory but  the more Ryan practises and applies the skills he learns in class, the more progress he will make. His results in the summative assessment were not representative of what Ryan can achieve. For this reason he needs to work harder in order to ensure his progression."
Amber,"Ryan -You show some understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  65%., Improve your concentration level. You should be more focused work hard to your potential use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work.

Amber,"Maria is a bright and active student, who usually contributes to class discussions. Her English level is good in all areas, however, she should dedicate some time to research during the winter break so that she can have a head start on coursework portfolio. In addition to this it is important that she gets familiar with the exam types before the summative exams as her formative listening marks suffered due to lack of familiarity with the exam format."
Green,"Maria is a very good student. She has a high standard of language and she is able to grasp key concepts quickly and with ease. She does not generally participate in class discussions, but is able to answer questions if asked. Her result in her first assignment was excellent and she should now aim to maintain this high standard of work going forward."
Amber,"You show some command of the subject.  which is 61%. You put in some good level of effort in your work, You need to be better engaged in class. You need to focus a little more in class. Try to actively participate in class. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,"Maria's level of attendance is very good but can improve.

Her level of participation the same as she has all the potential to engage more but she does not apply her critical mind in discussions that often (even though she is more than capable to do so).

I do believe that she can put much more effort in her studies. Her assessment has been very good but I doubt not she can improve on that."
Amber,"Maria has a high level of English, which definitely helps her be more active in group work and class discussions; however, she needs to improve her presenation skills and go through the appropriate academic language, which was covered in the textbook before. In addition to this, her writing skills require improvement, especially in terms of content and referencing. Reviewing term 1 and 2 materials on moodle will help her perform better in term 3 and AES CW2."
Green,Maria continues to be an excellent student. She has developed her maturity in term 2 and her work continues to be of a very high standard. In particular her presentation as part of formative 2 group work was excellent. She should focus on being more active in class as her contribution will be very valuable to other students and help her extend her understanding of the subject.
Green,"Maria - Your level of attendance is very good, participation is good in class. Your score is 74%, you put in a commendable level of effort in your work. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. Try to revise the topics taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle page."
Green,Maria has all the potential to achieve a lot through her studies. I have no doubt she will be progressing to her Undergraduate degree but I wish to point out that with a bit more commitment she could achieve much more.

He listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as a group. He is also fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. His writing skills, however, need further development.

Green,Yifan is a very good student. He is engaged in class and is able to answer questions intelligently with good grasp of the concepts. His first assignment was very good and if he continues this way he will have a very successful foundation year.
Amber,"Your participation is good in class. You demonstrate a good understanding of the subject. You have put in a good level of effort into your work. Your score is 65% to keep up your work, do keep considerable effort of making notes on paper, your aim should be to improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Amber,"Yifan has a good level in terms of attendance and participation but he can still improve on those. 

He needs to put a bit more effort in order to guarantee he will be progressing at the end of the year. He has all the capabilities to do so but he needs a bit more effort and determination towards that direction. 

His assessment was good but can improve."
Green,"Yifan demonstrates good speaking, reading and listening skills and actively contributes to all class discussions. Yifan has achieved well above 70% in all the above-mentioned three skills, which is more than the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. However, he needs to work hard to improve his academic writing skills. Attending virtual office hours and doing extra writing tasks on Moodle are recommended to improve his chances of progression."
Green,"Yifan's motivation has dropped a little during the recent term. He remains an intelligent student, but his application and attention have dropped a little. If he is to succeed on the course he cannot let this happen and needs to maintain his previous levels of commitment."
Amber,"Yifan - You show some understanding in class, You are an active participant in class at times. Your summative-1 score is  63% Your results in assessments have been fair so far. Improve your concentration level. You should be more focused work hard to your potential use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessment work. To improve your score, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle"
Green,Yifan had a very good S1 resit (65). He seems to be improving in both his communication skills and subject knowledge and this has been reflected with his marks. He needs to show the same commitment and determination in the future also.

Amber,"Pengfei has made good progress this term. He remains focused in class and consistently takes responsibility for his own share of work when participating in class and group activities. He is a highly-motivated student who participates in class activities with a great deal of enthusiasm. Pengfei is well-organised and works well independently and with others. Pengfei continues to demonstrate a keen interest in learning which has led to some improvement in his academic writing over the term. However, his listening skills need to be developed further. Pengfei should dedicate some time during his winter break to researching his CW1 to give himself a head start on researching the topic in Term 2."
Amber,Pengfei is a very good student. He fully engages in the class and participates in class discussions very energetically. He is able to discuss concepts with some good understanding. His first assignment result was disappointing so he must now listen carefully to the feedback and apply this to his work going forward.
Green,Pengfei puts a commendable level of effort into his work. He is making excellent progress and his participation is excellent in the class. He shows his interest and his attendance is excellent.  His results in the assessment are excellent.
Amber,"You have some fair knowledge of the topics that have been covered in class, you demonstrate some understanding of the subject, and you need to actively participate in the class discussion. Your score is 59%, need to use your potential to the maximum, considerable amount of notes is made by you in class, please put that into good use, while writing assignment make a flow chart with the notes written by you, revise material posted in Moodle you can progress your score further."
Green,"Pengfei is a conscientious, hard-working student. He tackles classroom assignments, tasks, and group work in an organised manner. He shows self-direction in goal-setting and goal achievement, and has made some good progress over the past two terms. He consistently scored over 50% for academic writing in the continuous assessment (60% in the last mock exam) and demonstrated some improvement across the other skills. He is responsive to feedback and builds positive relationships with his peers and tutors. What is more, Pengfei has made noticeable progress in terms of his reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where he was awarded a mark of 73%. If the student continues to work at this level in term 3, then he should achieve the required progression mark in Writing, pass the programme and achieve the grades needed for progression to his UG course at Royal Holloway University of London."
Amber,Pengfei is a good student and athough his english language skills need development he is often ready to participate in class discussions and will readily answer questions. His assessment result was good. In order to succeed on the course overall he must maintain his level of motivation and focus and if he does this I am very optimistic that he will succeed.
Green,"Pengfei is an excellent student. His attendance is great. He is always interested in the class, he participates and he engages with his homework. Pengfei should continue like this and he will have great results in the final exams."
Amber,"Pengfei - You attended is very good, you are an active participant at times in class discussions.  you are putting in considerable effort in your work. Your summative -1 score is 59%, Use more of subject-specific terminology in your assessments, your knowledge and understanding of the topics can be broadened further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."

Green,"Kalyn demonstrates good skills in all areas, however, she should dedicate some time to research during the winter break so that she can have a head start on her coursework portfolio. She should mainly focus on finding suitable sources for her coursework question and checking their credibility. She can also review the term 1 materials on Moodle and her textbook."
Green,"Kalyn is a very good student. The result in her first assignment was very good. She seems to have a good grasp of the concepts and, more importantly, is very capable of critical thinking. As a native english speaker she has an opportunity to excel on this course. One development point for her is to participate more in discussions in class to practice arguing her point and listening to the viewpoint of others. I fully expect Kalyn to succeed on the course."
Green,90% formative 1 result.  Kalyn has performed well in class and in this first assessment.  She mainly works independently to ensure her understanding and rarely asks for support.  Kalyn would benefit from supporting her peers in group work and at the maths club.
Amber,"Your participation is good in class. You demonstrate some understanding of the subject. You have put in a good level of effort into your work. Your score is 64% to keep up your work, Usually, you an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions, do keep considerable effort of making notes on paper, your aim should be to improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary, which will help you move forward."
Green,"Kalyn shows a keen interest in learning and usually completes her tasks in time. Although she has got good marks in all areas, reviewing the class materials on moodle will help her in term 3 too. Kalyn also can benefit form doing some extra timed writing tasks, which can be found on Moodle, as well."
Green,Kalyn remains a very strong student and her summative 1 result is a reflection of this. Term 3 will be very challenging for all of our students and I am very optimistic that Kalyn will rise to this challenge and continue her focussed studies to succeed on the course overall.
Amber,Summative 1 result 48%.  Kalyn was disappointed with the summative 1 result but this certainly does not reflect the level of effort she demonstrates in class and independently.  Kalyn is hard working and diligent and she can improve this result.
Green,"Kalyn -  You are a pleasure to teach, you are active in class and do participate in the class decisions at times. Your summative-1 score is 67%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work.  Use your knowledge of study concentrate more on subject-specific terminology. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further. Try to concentrate more on subject-specific terminology in the topic taught, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and moodle pages."

Green,"Yuen Yee is a conscientious and diligent student who has every potential to do very well on the IFY. She has demonstrated a critical approach to tasks in class and has a good understanding of the required skills, and thus she is making efforts to implement these skills into her classwork and assessments. She is also receptive to feedback and does well by acting upon it to help improve her performance. The areas that she needs to focus on are writing and reading. She can seek further support from drop-in clinics. I am confident that she will succeed on the IFY."
Amber,"Yuen is a good student, but she does not participate in class discussions neither is she able to answer questions when asked directly. She did achieve a good result in her first assignment so this shows that she is able to understand the material. I believe that her lack of class engagement is a result of her lack of language skills and I am worried that this will hold her back from succeeding as well as she possibly could. She needs to continue to develop her english and maintain a high level of focus and motivation."
Green,84% formative 1 result.  Christy works well with her peers and ensures she understands the concepts required for problem solving and this has been reflected in this assessment result.
Amber,"You demonstrate some command of the subject Your score is 58%, You put in some good level of effort in your work, and at times need to be better engaged in class. Usually, an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions. You need to focus a little more in class. Your performance is good but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,Yuen Yee's formative exam results in Term 1 and result for her summative CW1 have been very pleasing. She should continue to practise and build upon her four skills in order to improve her overall English language ability. A particular mention should be made about her CW1 result in which she scored above 80% and this is owing to her commitment to her AES studies. For Term 3 she should continue to strive for the best and to ask any questions to support her AES exams and assignments. I am confident that she will succeed on the IFY.
Green,"Yuen is a good student. She is very quiet, but has recently started contributing more to class discussions and this is a very good development. Her most recent assessment was good and this shows good promise for her success overall. I am optimistic that she will succeed on the course overall if she maintains this level of improvement going forward."
Green,"Summative 1 result 48%.  The summative 1 result is a little disappointing and Christy is capable of much more.  She must review all the concepts and prepare herself for the resit, seeking help where needed."
Green,"Yuen Yee - You are a pleasure to teach, you are active in class and do participate in the class decisions. Your summative-1 score is 71%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong but needs to stretch yourself further.

Amber,"Wai Kit has good speaking and reading skills, however, he needs to improve his seminar skills and practise using appropriate functional and academic language. He can also benefit from reviewing the writing materials on moodle and in his AES textbook. In addition to this, he should dedicate some time to research so that he can have a head start on his coursework portfolio. His formative marks suffered due to him missing the Listening exam."
Amber,"Ricky is a very energetic student who is always interested in giving his opinion in class. Occasionally his very positive confidence is a little beyond his capability, but I think this will balance out during the year. Ricky's first assignment was very good and this is a reflection of his very good engagement in class. Ricky now needs to reflect on the feedback and maintain his high level of energy to succeed on the course."
Green,"100% formative 1 result.  Ricky is a good mathematician at this level who pays attention to detail to ensure accuracy.  However, he must not be complacent and would do well to stretch his understanding with the extra work in the course handbook and preparing for the statistics in the next unit."
Green,"You show some command of the subject. This is clearly shown in your score, which is 65 %. You put in some good level of effort in your work, but you need to be better engaged in class. You need to focus a little more in class. Your performance is good, but need to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Amber,"Wai shows determination to learn but he needs to make more effort to improve his weaker skills, namely, reading and writing. He has improved his Academic English Skills since the beginning of the term but his weaker skills require further improvement. It is important that he engages in independent study resources available to him on Moodle and in her AES textbook."
Green,"Ricky is a very good student who is very confident. Unfortunately this term his engagement and focus in class has reduced somewhat. However, his most recent assessment result was very good and this is a result of some good work. His standard of english is excellent and this will support his efforts to gain high marks in his studies. I am very optimistic that Ricky will succeed on the course. I am also very optimistic that the educational experience will develop his personal skills."
Green,"Summative 1 result 99%.  Ricky is an able and confident mathematician.  However, he does need to be aware that his peers may not have the same capability and support in problem solving is more appropriate than other conversations.  Ricky will do well mathematically and in all he puts his mind to.   Well done Ricky."
Green,"TSang -  Your level of attendance is very good. You have a good command of the subject. You actively participate in group discussion. It is clearly shown in your summative score which is 77%.

Green,"Maria demonstrates an active interest in her academic studies and self-direction in learning. She approaches new challenges and tasks with motivation, eagerness, and confidence. What is more, she is able to use information and different technologies effectively and has, consequently, experienced a good deal of success this term. She willingly accepts various roles within the class and group situations, including the role of a leader. She is an active participant in group learning activities and consistently demonstrates respect and consideration for her peers. It is recommended that Maria dedicates some time during her winter break to researching her CW1 in order to give herself a head start on researching the topic in Term 2."
Green,64% formative 1 result.  Maria works well in class paying attention to detail to solve problems and supporting her peers.  Maria must review errors in this first assessment and seek support to ensure she is prepared for the next assessment.
Amber,"Maria's level of attendance has been excellent and so has her participation in class.

She seems to be putting a good level of work in her learning and I believe her to be one of the brightest students in this cohort.

While her assessment did not reflect these comments above, it is something that we can work together in order to improve."
Amber,"Maria's level of attendance has been excellent, the same with her participation in class. 

She is putting effort in her studying and this is evident with her note-taking and participation in class.

While her assessment has not been as successful as I had expected, I am certain she will improve a lot in the next ones."
Green,"Maria welcomes new tasks and seeks new opportunities for learning, especially when this involves group work. She has demonstrated a positive attitude towards
learning and shown excellent leadership skills. She has successfully taken advantage of all the learning opportunities that the AES course has had to offer over the past two terms. Maria has worked hard throughout the term and greatly contributed to the positive class atmosphere. With regard to her academic results, Maria consistently scores 60% (and higher) for writing in the continuous formative assessment. What is more, she has made noticeable progress in terms of her reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where she was awarded a mark of 86%. Maria is to be congratulated on her achievements and encouraged to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout term 3."
Green,Summative 1 result 75%.  Maria has demonstrated that practise and effort will reflect in improved grades.  Maria has worked hard in class and is always supportive of her peers.  I have no doubt Maria will be successful in whatever she decides to do in the future.
Green,I have no worries about Maria's ability to progress. Her level of participation and commitment have been consistently extremely high and I am certain she will do great at undergraduate level as well.
Green,Maria's commitment has been shown with her results in S1. Her participation and attendance have been excellent and it was reflected with her grade. I have no concerns at all about her progression.

Green,"Clara is a bright and enthusiastic student who shows a keen interest in classes. Her seminar, reading and writing skills are very good, however, she can benefit from practising timed writing using the structure which was covered in AES classes. In addition to this, Clara should dedicate some time to research during the winter break so that she can have a head start on the coursework portfolio."
Amber,"It is, at the moment, difficult for me to judge your work with much certainty as I have not yet seen an assignment from you, something we have already discussed. I look forward to reading your work. Your non-submission was not the attitude you generally show in class, which is that of an engaged and attentive student, so more of that please! However, you are keen to work in groups and also in class discussion, as well as participating in lectures - and all of this provides a strong basis for your work in the new term."
Green,"Clara is an exceptional student with many positive qualities. Her formative 1 result was among the highest in class and she has shown herself to be an intelligent and articulate young person with great potential. Clara's attendance is of some concern to me though and I worry that without more consistency, she may struggle a little to achieve the high grades she is clearly able to achieve. After Christmas, I would like Clara to work on improving her attendance."
Green,"Clara has a lot of potential as a student and I believe she will be able to live up to that potential.

Her attendance in class has been generally very good, although she has missed a couple of classes/lectures.

Her participation in class is nonetheless excellent.

She seems to be putting effort in studying and I do not believe she will have issues with progressing.

I however cannot confirm my assumptions above as she did not submit a formative assignment."
Green,"Clara demonstrates good listening, speaking and reading skills. Her writing skills, however requires further improvement. She can do some self-study on Moodle. Viewing the writing materials available on moodle and in her text book will likely improve her writing skills. In addition to this, Clara should dedicate some time to CW2 so that she can finish by the deadline."
Green,"You have learnt from your experience with Formative 1 - well done. Your Summative 1 mark was excellent - and your Formative 2 mark was nearly as good. Your participation in class is astute and insightful, so well done. This term has seen your performance change for the better - you should be pleased, so well done. In order to continue this with the transition to online learning, make sure you remain organised. You also need to focus on a successful Summative 2, which will require continuing to engage with primary texts and secondary literature."
Green,"Clara is a wonderful student with great potential. She has demonstrated her creativity and imagination and, when she is in class she is an active member of our class. I am confident that Clara will do very well and needs only to work on her organisational skills and ensure that classes are not missed. Having said this, I do not want to end these comments on a positive note as I have full faith that she will perform strongly in the final assessment a few weeks from now."
Green,Clara has a lot of potential but she needs to focus her attention to learning at the University level. I often had the feeling that learning was secondary for her during her England experience. She has a lot of promise and potential but she needs to re-focus her attention on learning.

Amber,"Polly is a hard-working and conscientious student. I advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly in class. She listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as a group. She is also fully engaged in class shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. Her writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops and doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to her on Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,"You have worked very hard this term in Arts - well done. Your assignment mark was very good, providing you with a solid foundation for next term's work. You are also keen to participate in class, making meaningful and insightful contributions to class discussions. You also work well in groups. It would be good to hear more from you in lectures, as you are a bit quieter in that environment and this would be the next step for you. Overall, you have plenty to build on next term."
Green,Polly is a strong student. Her attendance has been very good on the whole and she has shown a good aptitude for this subject. Polly should now concentrate on revising her notes and raising the sophistication of her interpretations by working on her written communication. A delight to have in the classroom.
Amber,"Pollie's level of attendance is quite good but can improve. 

Her participation in class is very good. but can even improve more.

She seems to be putting a good amount of effort in her studying. 

I am afraid I have no way of knowing whether that effort has offered the appropriate results as she has not submitted a formative assessment."
Green,"I am very pleased with the attitude of and progress being made in AES course by Polly. She is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. She has handed all of her homework in on time and to a high standard. Polly has achieved above 70% in overall grades, which is well above the English language requirement for her chosen degree, which is an excellent result for this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!"
Green,"Your Summative 1 was good and so too was your Formative 2 mark, so well done. This gives you a good foundation for Summative 2 when it comes in June. You should be thinking about how to maximise success for this assignment. For this, you should be working with the primary text closely and engaging with good secondary literature. In order to make this easier, continue to participate in class discussion (which you do already) and carry on working hard."
Green,"Polly is a wonderful student with great potential. She has demonstrated great commitment to her studies and is an active member of our class. I am confident that Polly will do very well and needs only to work a little harder on her written English, something she ran into trouble with in her early formative assessment. Nonetheless, I have full faith in her capability and believe she will perform strongly in the final assessment a few weeks from now."
Green,"Pollie has been consistently very good in terms of participation in class, attendance and commitment. This was portrayed also with her results in S1. I believe Pollie will be able to progress if she continues with the same level of commitment and determination."

She has a good understanding of the required skills, and she is making efforts to implement these skills into her classwork and assessments. The area that she needs to focus on is writing, particularly since the requirement is 70%. She can seek support from drop-in clinics and by acting upon the feedback given on written work. I am confident that she will succeed on the IFY."
Amber,"You readily contribute in class and make insightful and meaningful comments, so well done. However, your assignment mark did not reflect the level of work of which you are clearly capable - as we will discuss in your tutorial. This is something for you to work on for the next assignment, as it is summative. However, in class, you should continue to work as you have been; making sure you make the most of the opportunities for group work and class discussion as well as engaging with the texts."
Green,"Xinru is a delight to have in the classroom as she is an active member of our group. She is always very positive and attentive, and these qualities make her both popular amongst her peers and also resulted in her achieving one of the top grades in the class. Xinru must polish her presentation skills though, as this needs a little more work."
Green,"Xinru's level of attendance is good but can most definitely improve. 

Her participation in class is generally very good but there is room for improvement. 

She seems to be putting an adequate amount of effort in her studies and her learning and academic skills are improving.

Her assessment was good but she has the capabilities and potential to improvbe a lot."
Green,"Xinru continues to demonstrate every potential to do well in her English studies. Her formative results in Term 1 and her summative result for CW1 in Term 2 have overall been pleasing. The key skills that she needs to improve on are her speaking and writing. For her speaking, I believe that more careful preparation and confidence will help boost her performance, while her writing skills could be improved by simply practising and getting feedback from her tutor. For Term 3, she should work hard to obtain the highest writing score possible for CW3 to ensure she achieves progression comfortably. I am confident that she will succeed on the IFY."
Amber,"Ultimately, your Summative work was successful - well done. You did not submit any Formative work - and we discussed this in your tutorial. It is hard for me to chart your progress on this front, so I look forward to reading this work in the next couple of weeks. However, your classwork is generally strong: you make good contributions to discussions and this stands you in good stead. You need to continue to engage with primary and secondary literature to ensure success over the next term."
Green,"Xinru is a wonderful student with great potential. She has demonstrated great commitment to her studies and is an active member of our class. I am confident that Xinru will do very well and needs only to think harder about how best to showcase her creativity in terms of film and media terminology (e.g. technical and symbolic codes). Nonetheless, I have full faith that she will perform strongly in the final assessment a few weeks from now."
Amber,I expected Xinru to do a resit for S1 but she did not submit anything. Her S1 mark was not that good (56). She also has shown a patchy level of commitment to learning throughout the year. She has all the capacity and capabilities to progress but she needs to put more effort and commitment into progressing.

Amber,"Anna is a bright and mature student who usually comes to class prepared and contributes as much as she can. However, in order to benefit most from term 2, she should review term 1 material which will help her perform better in tern 3 at AES and CW1"
Amber,"Well done on a focussed term's work in Arts. I know you were disappointed by your assignment mark, but it gives you a very strong foundation for your summative assignment - and we have discussed ways in which you can improve the mark relatively easily. You have shown yourself to be hard-working and articulate as a student - so well done. I look forward to seeing more of the same in the New Year, and hopefully you will be able to use the feedback from the Formative Assignment for a better Summative."
Amber,Anna is very active during the classes and always comes prepared. She needs to improve her academic writing and to widen her reading. I am confident that with sustained work she will achieve progression.
Green,"Anna's participation and attendance levels have been excellent.

She seems to be putting a lot of effort in her studies and this will be rewarded. 

She might not have done as well as I expected in her assessment but she has all the capabilities and determination to achieve a progression mark and much more."
Amber,"Anna is a bright and attentive student, who contributes to group and pair works in class. She also submits her assignments in time successfully. However, Anna may benefit from some extra reading activities, which can be found on  moodle. She should also review term 1 and 2 materials on Moodle and that will help her perform better in term 3 and AES CW3,"
Amber,"You are a very conscientious student in Arts: you make valuable and pertinent contributions to class at every opportunity showing your dedication to the course. You were, I know, somewhat disappointed by your Summative results. However, you did not submit a Formative 2, so it is difficult for me to judge your progress beyond that at this point, though we have agreed a new deadline for this work. However, you have the opportunity to ensure we turn this around. In your case, you need to focus on maintaining analysis rather than description in your work, using plenty of secondary literature and referring to the primary text frequently. Your classwork remains excellent."
Amber,"Anna's essay for the Summative Assessment 1 shows some progress, however she will need to allocate some more time for independent study. I appreciated a lot her contributions in class: they have been very valuable and indicated determination and self-discipline. I recommend that in the last term she focuses on improving her academic writing skills (structure, flow of argumentation and critical skills)."
Amber,I thought Anna would have done a resit as her S1 was not that good but she has not. Her grade was good but not in the range of progression (57) and she will struggle a bit to attain a progression mark.

care. He follows classroom routines and instructions independently and
displays a positive attitude towards learning. Parbind consistently completes and submits all assignments for evaluation on time. He works well independently, shows a high level of motivation, and is a risk taker, especially when working on tasks that require problem solving and creativity. Parbind consistently seeks new opportunities for learning. He contributes positively to class discussions and co-operative group activities. Parbind is encouraged to assess his own work and identify goals to strive for."
Green,"Parbind is an excellent student. He is fully engaged in class, participates fully and has a good grasp of the concepts. HIs first assignment result reflected this and was very good. I expect Parbind to do very well on this course and to have a very successful foundation year as long as he maintains this level of motivation."
Green,"You are a pleasure to teach. You have an excellent command of the subject. This is clearly shown in your score, which is 74%.

What is more, it can be said that Parbind tackles classroom assignments, tasks, and group work in an organised manner. He has made noticeable progress in terms of his reading and research skills, as demonstrated in CW1 where he was awarded a mark of 86%. As part of a group, Parbind makes group collaboration straightforward as he offers constructive suggestions to peers to enhance their performance. Not only that, he also accepts the recommendations of his peers and acts on feedback when appropriate, always searching for ways to improve. Parbind is to be congratulated on his achievements so far and encouraged to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout Term 3. He is well on his way to achieving the marks needed for progression to his UG course at Royal Holloway."
Green,Parbind is an excellent student. He is well organised and continues to be motivated and focussed on his studies. He is able to concentrate well in class and asks intelligent questions.

Amber,"Parbind's essay for the Summative Assessment 1 shows some progress, however more time needs to be allocated not only for independent study, but also to improve the academic writing skills (especially the critical skills). I recommend that he allocates more time to independent study and he completes the homework regularly."

Amber,"Since the beginning of the term, Sultan has made a considerable progress and improved his speaking and writing skills. He usually contributes to the lessons and works quite well in group as well individually. However, he still needs to study hard to get his required mark to progress. Reviewing term 1 material available to him on Moodle and working on Academic word list word will hep him perform better in term 2."
Green,64% formative 1 result.  Sultan has performed well in class and errors in the test are technically minor.  I expect a much better result in the next assessment following some revision.
Green,"Sultan is a very good student with a great attendance.
He is always interested and organised. He works hard and wants to improve.
His report is very good. Some more corrections that we will discuss in the feedback can contribute for a higher grade in the summative assessment."
Amber,"Sultan is a good student that shows interest in the class. His attendance is excellent.  He works hard, he is organised and he has shown great improvement during the term. As a result he is no longer required to attend the mandatory workshops that were suggested to him due to his low score in his first maths placement test. 
One skill that he needs to improve is his critical thinking and applying the theory in more difficult exercises. This can be achieved with more practise and independent study. He can achieve higher grades and ensure the progression with some more effort and practice."
Amber,"Sultan has a good level of English and has been attending his AES classes regularly since the beginning of term 1. 
Sultan has made considerable progress and improved his research and writing skills since the beginning of the term. Sultan, who is a bright and enthusiastic student, usually contributes to the lessons and works quite well in groups as well as individually. Furthermore, he is responsible and always submits his homework and assignments on time. His Coursework 1 result is also satisfying. Reviewing term 2 material available to him on Moodle will help him perform better in term 3. He should also start working on the remaining components of the AES Research project (CW2 and CW3).
Regarding his behaviour, he is a respectful, well-behaved and cooperative student. He has a good rapport with the tutor and other students in the class."
Green,Over the last term Sultan has applied himself to the study of Statistics and shown a mature attitude to independent study.  His formative result whilst not quite reaching the required level demonstrated the improvement he has made to his overall studies of mathematics.  Sultan engages with the resources available on Moodle and completes the set tasks.  He asks questions when unable to find a solution and engages fully in all classroom activities.  Sultan has not completed a summative 1 exam due to the current exceptional circumstances but he was expected to achieve a higher result than the previous formative assessment.  He also has an opportunity to perform well in the poster presentation and achieve his required goal.
Amber,Sultan attends all the classes in Physics and he engages with the work that is asked from him. His lab report was very good and he achieved a high grade (87%). In his second formative assessment he did not perform well (33%). He needs to study and work harder for the Physics exam as he needs to become familiar with the formulas and the theory. His engagement in the class has decreased as well. Sultan will be capable of achieving a high grade in Physics and continue to show a great progress if he does significant independent study and improve his engagement in the class by asking and answering questions in the class.
Amber,"Sultan is a very good student who has shown a great attendance and interest in the class. He works hard and he is concentrated in his goal. In his Summative 1 assessment Sultan achieved a very good grade (~70%).  I give an orange rating to Sultan only because his Formative Assessment 2 was not so as good (~50%) as his previous assessments. He showed that he had studied but he still gets confused with the integration methods. In the third term he should not lose his focus and achieve again a high grade. More exercises and independent study are suggested in order Sultan will achieve a higher grade. The tutor will advise him to attend the mandatory workshops if it is needed in order to ensure that Sultan will achieve a total mark higher that 65% to progress to the University.  In general, Sultan is a great example of student that has shown great progress in comparison with his placement test when he joined the center."

Amber,"Aljazi is a bright and attentive student, who likes doing group and pair work in class. She may benefit from some extra reading activities, which can be found on  moodle. She should review term 1 material on Moodle and that will help her perform better in term 2 and AES CW1,"
Green,"You yourself have owned that you have not always engaged as fully as you might have done with this module and that time management skills have let you down. This was impressive self-appraisal - in the New Year, you need to think about how you are going to manage your time better and ensure that you are engaging more fully with the course outside the classroom. In the classroom, your participation is very good, but it seems that you need to spend more time with the set texts.  This will help you improve for your summative assignment and lead to more focused work in the classroom too."
Green,Aljazi's mark for the formative assessment 1 already showed a good understanding of Global Politics. I appreciate her contributions to the class and her incisive comments. She is conscientious and hard working and I am certain that she will achieve progression.
Green,"Aljazi has had a very good level of attendance and has missed very few if any classes.

Her level of participation is also very good.

She seems to be putting a very good level of effort in studying and this will be rewarded. 
Her assessment mark was very good but I am sure she can do much better."
Green,"Aljazi has been a great student who has been following her tutor`s advice since the beginning of the first term, which is positively reflected in her CW1 result. She actively listens to the lessons and contributes to pair works as well as class discussions. However, she should do some independant study referring to the sources on Moodle.  She would also benefit form doing the mock exams on moodle."
Green,"You are a dedicated student in Arts and this has paid off with both your Summative 1 and Formative 2. Both are strong marks, which together give you an excellent foundation for your Summative 2 in June. You should carry on reading the primary texts as you have been - and making the pertinent comments in class that you have been. Further engagement with secondary literature will help the quality of your writing for your final assignment. Overall, you should be pleased."
Green,"Aljazi's essay for the Summative Assessment 1 shows that she has kept up the good work. It exhibits a good knowledge of politics, very good research skills and an increased ability to engage critically with various topics."
Green,"Aljazi has shown commitment and determination throughout the year. I believe she is a very driven young lady that will have no issues with progressing. Having said that, I believe she still has a lot of potential and she needs to continue pushing herself."

Green,Aleksandr demonstrates good skills in all areas. He also contributes to class discussions and shows a very positive attitude towards learning. He should dedicate some time to research over the winter break so that he can have a head start on coursework portfolio. He should mainly focus on finding suitable sources for his coursework question and checking their credibility.
Amber,"58% formative 1 result.  This result was less than expected given the good performance in class.  However, having reviewed the questions with Aleksandr the errors are relatively minor and the expectation is that the next assessment will have a much better result."
Green,Aleksandr is a very good student. His attendance is very good. He shows interest in the class and great participation. This hard work is shown in his results.
Green,"Aleksandr is a great student. He does his best, he participates in the class and he has very good results because of his hard work."
Green,"Alexandr is a bright and attentive student, who likes doing group and pair work in class. He usually submits his work in time and attends the classes regularly. He may benefit from some extra reading activities, which can be found on  moodle. He should also review term 1 and term 2 materials on Moodle that will help him perform better in term 3."
Green,Alexandr has worked consistently throughout the first two terms and demonstrates a real commitment to his studies including  bringing interesting ideas to class for his peers to share.  The summative assessments to be taken in term 3 will undoubtedly demonstrate a high level of achievement.
Green,"Aleksandr has shown great attendance in the class. He is a very good student with a good background in physics. This is reflected in his great grade in his lab report. In this term Aleksandr has lost a bit his concentration and his dedication that showed the first semester.  He is usually relatively quiet in class although he know the answers in the questions. His results for the formative assessment were good. 
Aleksandr should not miss his goal and continue his hard work in order to ensure a place in the university next year."
Amber,"Aleksandr did not have good attendance during this term in Maths. Aleksandr had a good mark in the Maths assessment but he can achieve much higher. He has a continuous interest to progress. He has potential and when he attends the class and participates shows good progress. 
He should focus again in his final exam and work as hard as he did in the first term.
If he follows this advice, he can have excellent results in his assessments."

Amber,"The attitude of and progress being made by Kevin was impressive. He tends to be participating actively in lesson discussions and he is fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term.  I am sure he will continue to make progress with his positive attitude. His writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops and doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to him on Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,"You have worked very hard this term in Arts and this has really paid off, so well done. Your formative assignment mark was very good, reflecting not only the time you spent on the assignment, but also the quality of the reading you did. You should be very pleased with this mark - and it puts you in an excellent position for next term. In class too, you contribute insightfully both in groups and in class discussion. Overall, you should carry on as you are in order to carry on being successful!"
Green,"You are doing much better than you think! You have worked hard in music - and this has come across in the quality of your work and the way you participate in class. It is good to see you contribute, but also that you are not afraid to ask when you are unsure about something. Your formative assignment was very good - so when you have taken the feedback into account and have had a chance to work with it, you will be able to improve your work further."
Green,"Kevin's attendance levels and determination are extremely high. He seems to be one of the most determined students in this cohort. 

His learning and academic skills have been improving constantly, mainly due to this. 

His assessment has been very good and can only get better."
Amber,"Kevin demonstrates good speaking, reading and listening skills and actively contributes to all class discussions. Kevin has achieved above 65% in the overall grades in terms of the above-mentioned three skills, which is more than the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. However, he needs to work harder to improve his academic writing skills. Attending virtual office hours and doing extra writing tasks in his AES book and on Moodle are recommended to improve his chances of progression."
Green,"You continue to work very hard in Arts, making valuable contributions to class discussions. This has paid dividends: you have very strong marks for both Summative 1 and Formative 2. Formative 2 gives you a solid foundation for the work that is to come in term 3 - and for which you are well-prepared. You should carry on reading the texts and engaging with the secondary literature in order to be successful."
Green,"You have worked very hard in Music and proven a dedicated student. This has paid off with excellent marks for both Summative 1 and Formative 2 (on a trajectory that is ever-improving). Well done. You participate in class in meaningful and intelligent way and show that you engage in the work that is asked of you. In order to ensure success for the final part of the course, try not to worry too much, but instead focus your energy on carrying on with this work - and particularly honing your skills reflecting on your practical work."
Green,Kevin has showed excellent levels of commitment and determination throughout the year. His S1 result might not have been good but he came back with an excellent effort in his S1 resit. I have no doubts he will be able to progress.

Green,"Titus has been a real pleasure to teach: polite, attentive and driven, he participates fully in all class activities and makes interesting and thoughtful contributions to academic discussions. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented him and his classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, Titus's performance in the mock assessments throughout the term indicates he has a  good understanding of the concepts taught in the AES module so far and can successfully employ a range of exam strategies. That said, there is still some room for improvement in Titus's performance, particularly in terms of academic writing. Provided he continues working hard, I have no doubt whatsoever that Titus will be in a position to meet his AES progression requirements."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment. Titus understanding of the material is very good, he attends regularly and pays attention in class. His test result was quite good (74%). To improve the results further I suggest to do more work at home between classes and send it for feedback."
Green,"Titus has excellent attendance in the class. He is always interested, he consistently participates actively in class and makes a valuable contribution to class discussions. He is conscientious student and always engages with his work in the class or his homework. His report results are very good."
Amber,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment. Titus is working regularly, asks questions, understands the material. Unfortunately his test result was lower then expected (62%). To improve the situation, I suggest to practice more at home and send the work regularly for comments and feedback. I am sure Titus has a potential to achieve very good results."
Green,"Titus has a positive attitude to learning and he respects his tutors and classmates. He is a bright, attentive and hardworking student. He takes care to participate fully in all class activities and can always be counted on to make interesting contributions to class discussions. His reading, speaking and writing skills are very good but he can improve his academic writing, practising paraphrasing and summarising skills. He can refer to Moodle, where he can find some extra materials such as short lectures or exam practice."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the second formative assessment. Titus understanding of material is very good, he is always active in class and submits his homework regularly. This resulted in excellent result in the test - 100%."
Green,"Titus is a great student that attends always the class and he participates.
He is interested to improve his skills and he asks for help when this is needed. This is important, as he collaborates nicely with his tutor and aims to achieve a high score for his final results. Titus did excellent in his lab report."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Titus is a very strong and committed student. He has 100% attendance record, he is working in class and doing the homework every week. His test result is 92%. No worries whatsoever."

He takes care to participate fully in all class activities and can always be counted on to make interesting and insightful contributions to class discussions. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented him and his classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, Rashid’s performance in the mock assessments throughout the term indicates has a  good understanding of the concepts taught in the AES module so far and can successfully employ a range of exam strategies.That said, there is still some room for improvement in Rashid’s performance, particularly in terms of academic writing. Rashid should, therefore, devote some time during the Spring break to revise academic writing principles taught in Term 1 and do some independent writing practice to ensure he performs to an even higher standard in Tern 2 exams."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment. Rashid is very responsible and hardworking student. He attends classes and all workshops regularly. His test result was very good (74%). Well done, keep up with the good work!"
Green,"Rashid has performed very well in Physics the first term. His attendance is very good and he is interested in the class. His report in physics was very good (85%). Rashid’s report was lacking in the conclusion chapter as it did not include all the essential information. The explanation of his data analysis was a bit weak as well.  In the class students were asked to mark other students report and a feedback discussion followed. By this way all the students understood better what is asked from our marks scheme. If Rashid follows the advice that was given to him on how to improve his report, he can achieve an excellent grade. Rashid should continue to work at this level for the next semester. Then he will achieve to pass the programme and progress to the University."
Amber,These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment (72%). Rashid pays attention to the lectures and is very keen to learn. He attends the workshops regularly and he is doing the homework as well. He has shown considerable improvement of his Maths level since the beginning of the year. I am very confident Rashid will achieve very good overall result.
Green,"Rashid has a postive attitude and is very cooperative in live sessions. Rashid demonstrates great listening, reading, speaking skills. He also contributes to group discussions and demonstrates a good level of critical thinking. However, Rashid should dedicate some time to improve his writing skills, especially synthesising and organising so that he can score higher in his CW3."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the second formative assessment. Rashid missed a few classes due to relocation, but now he is paying attention and he is working hard. His test result is 95%. I am sure that Rashid will pass the year with a very good results."
Green,Rashid is a great student and in his physics report he did very good. He is keen on physics and how to progress. He engages with the given tasks for physics in the class and if he continues like this he will have a very good grade in this summative 2 as well.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Rashid missed a few classes due to relocation, but he did a recovery work, attended a workshop. His test result is good (76%), but I believe there is a scope for improvement. I recommend to submit the homework regularly for feedback."

Green,"Ilsa is a bright, intelligent young woman, whose contributions to class discussions are highly valued by her peers and tutors alike. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented her and her classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, Ilsa’s performance in continuous assessment tasks to date indicate she  has a  good understanding of the concepts taught in the AES module so far and can successfully employ a range of exam strategies. Though her academic writing still needs some improvement, particularly in relation to paraphrasing and referencing accurately, Ilsa’s been making steady progress in this area and, provided she continues working hard in Terms 2 & 3, I am confident she will meet her progression requirements in the AES module."
Amber,"You have a lot of potential in Arts, but currently this is not always being shown. Your Formative Assignment (other than the late submission) was promising - and if you continue on this trajectory then you should do well. However, you need to work hard in order for this to happen. When you do work hard, your contributions are meaningful, insightful, and relevant. Overall, you have laid some good foundations, but there is still work to be done."
Green,"Ilsa is a very clever young lady but she needs to show some more commitment towards learning and respect towards the environment of the classroom. She often comes to class late (she also has issues with her attendance), she often eats during class without even asking permission, while I have never seen her take notes. 
Nonetheless, she always answers questions in class, contributes to our discussion, and she seems to understand all our topics. I have no worries over her progression but she needs to improve her attitude towards learning."
Green,My comments for Ilsa in Sociology are similar to my comments for her in Psychology. She has a lot of potential but she needs to commit more to her studies and improve her overall behaviour during class.
Green,"Ilsa is an active, bright student, who enthusiastically participates in class activities and contributes to discussions. She attends the live sessions regularly and cooperates with her tutor and classmates. While her reading, speaking and listening skills are very good, she can work on her writing skills, especially to improve her paraphrasing, summarising and referencing skills. For extra materials, she can refer to Moodle, where she can find short lectures and mock exams"
Green,"Your Summative 1 was very successful - well done. You now need to continue to build on this as we move into the final part of the course. Sometimes your attendance is somewhat patchy, but you engage well when you are present. Please build on this, as it is a pleasure to hear from you and your contributions are valuable. Work hard on your Formative as preparation for your Summative 2, and the rest of the course looks promising for you."
Green,"Ilsa is one of the best students, if not the best, in this cohort. She is smart and I remember her being able to grasp key ideas discussed in class. Moving to e-learning and teaching, she seems to have adapted easily and is able to portray her knowledge and understanding via online classes as well. She should continue the same way."
Green,"My comments for Ilsa in Sociology are the same for Psychology. The move to e-learning and e-teaching has been good for her, as she has been able to show excellent dedication and determination. Her S1 was excellent and she needs to continue at the same level."

Pascal should dedicate some time to research over the winter break so that he can have a head start on his coursework portfolio. He should mainly focus on finding credible sources for his coursework question."
Green,"You are clearly a capable student. However, your attendance is not always good - this is something you should work to change in the new term. When you are in class, you do participate, but you could perhaps work a bit harder. You would gain more from the course if you did so; try and take a really active role in class discussions, for example. Your formative assignment mark was good, providing a solid foundation for you to work from, but you should and could aim higher for your summative."
Green,Pascal's formative essay showed a good understanding of global politics. I recommend that he focuses on improving his academic writing and recommend to allocate time for independent study and doing his homework every week.
Green,"Pascal seems to be a very bright man.

His level of attendance is good although he has missed a couple of classes.

His participation in class is also very good but he can also improve on that. 

He seems to be putting effort in studying and engaging with Sociology.

I believe he will have no issues with progressing but I have no way of confirming this as he did not submit a formative assignment."
Green,"Pascal is a bright and responsible student, who usually comes to classes prepared. He contributes to class discussions and enjoys partticipates in pair work and group work. However, he can benefit from doing some independant study. Reviewing term 1 and 2 materials on moodle will also help him perform better in term 3 and AES CW2."
Amber,"Your Summative 1 was good, your Formative 2 less so. There is a sense that you could engage further with the course and make a bit more of an effort. Try reading the texts and engaging more with secondary literature in order to boost your marks and ensure that you are ultimately successful in this module. In online discussion it would be good to see you take an active role in discussion, rather than a more passive one: you have good contributions to make, but rarely make them. Try and get over this hurdle in the coming term."
Green,Pascal's essay for the Summative Assessment 1 shows good progress. He has gained good knowledge and understanding of politics and improved his academic writing skills. I recommend that he devotes more time to independent study and completes his homework regularly.
Amber,"Pascal is another individual who is not doing justice to himself. His S1 was not good (56) and although I expected him to submit a resit he did not. Now he will have a lot to do for a progression mark.
Pascal seems to have not taken studying at the Foundation Year seriously and this is reflected in his marks. He is more than capable for a progression mark and even more but he has not shown the adequate seriousness and commitment. He needs to do that if he is to progress now."

She also needs reminders to stay focused on the task at hand. She continues to seek tutor's clarification for assignments and is encouraged to ask further questions to clarify meaning and ensure understanding. Greater focus in class would also help improve the quality of her academic work."
Amber,"Mehrnoush is a very good student. She is attentive in class and makes contributions to class discussions. Mehrnoush can sometimes seem a little disorganised so should pay attention to developing in this area. Preparing for classes and arriving on time for example. Mehrnoush has followed up on the online learning work well.
I am very optimistic about Mehrnoush's success on the course, but she must continue to apply herself consistently to the work to ensure success."
Amber,"Mehrnoush- You are a pleasure to teach, are active in class and do participate in the class discussions too. Your summative-1 score is 65%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong but you need to stretch yourself further. Try to concentrate more on subject-specific terminology in the topics taught; please engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist, and other sources outlined in the module handbook and Moodle page."
Amber,Mehrnoush is working very hard to reach progression. She is very conscientious and seems to devote time for independent study. She has always completed her homework and her contributions in class are very valuable. I believe that an increased proficiency in English will also improve her grades in Politics.
Green,"In term 2, Mehrnoush has participated well and engaged well with the online delivery mode. As a result, the student has managed to stay on top of the AES assignments and met the requirements of the course. It is hoped that this positive attitude towards her studies will continue throughout term 3. It is recommended that Mehrnoush continues to seek her AES tutor's clarification and ask further questions in order to ensure understanding. The student should make the most of the mock exams available on the WISEflow platform to practise and prepare herself before her summative exams in June. She should also put some time aside to start working on her CW2 summative presentation as well as CW3 extended researched essay which are both due in term 3."
Amber,"Mehrnoush remains a good student. Her result on the summative was a little disappointing, but I am hopeful that she has understood the feedback and will act on this. In order to succeed on the course Mehrnoush will need to be organised and remain focussed, undertaking all of the necessary work that is asked of her. I am hopeful that if she can maintain a consistent approach to her work Mehrnoush will be successful on the course."

Sila possesses strong English language skills which places her in good stead, and she has also demonstrated a good understanding of the teaching material in Term 1 and she has attempted to use this in her classwork and homework. Her mock exams have overall been pleasing and I am confident that with more careful preparation and regular practice, Sila will do very well on the IFY."
Green,"You have worked very hard in Arts this term and it has paid off. You have a good Formative Assignment mark which will give you a solid basis for your Summative Assignment. Moreover, your contributions in class are plentiful, pertinent and insightful - so well done for your work here. You are also conscientious in group work, showing that you remain focused on the topic at hand. Overall, you should be pleased."
Amber,"Sila is likely to reach progression, but she needs to devote more time and on weekly basis to independent study and to improve on her self- discipline. She has been involved in the class discussions and her contributions have been very valuable."
Amber,"Sila is very good student in class and she participates in our discussion often. Her formative assignment however was not good, which worries me a bit. I am certain though she will be able to pick up and be able to progress."
Green,"There has been a noticeable change in Sila's commitment to her English studies since moving to the new mode of teaching. This is a little concerning as it was not an issue when we were having face to face lessons. She has so far shown herself to be less engaged and motivated in terms of carrying out her weekly MOODLE tasks and her attendance at live ZOOM sessions has also been low, but in recent weeks this has begun to improve. I'm hoping that in the coming weeks she'll step up and focus more on her CW1 final draft as she has shown some confusion regarding CW1 requirements; better engage in a more timely manner with the on-line mock exams in order to be better placed for her summatives at the end of term 2."
Amber,"You work very hard in Arts - and this is plain to see: well done! You take a full and active part in classes, showing that you have not only read the texts, but thought about them. Your assignment mark was good, but you have the potential to do better, so you need to focus on your writing in order to achieve more highly in your Summative 2. Work hard on your Formative as it gives you the opportunity to practise the skills you need. All in all, there is much for you to be pleased about - but you should build on this for the final part of the course."
Amber,"Sila's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 shows a good progress from the Formative. I believe, however, that the grade does not reflect her knowledge of politics and ability to engage with various topics. I am confident that the Resit grade will mirror these more accurately. I recommend that she allocates enough time every week to complete the homework for Politics."
Green,Sila is a very smart girl who often shows an excellent level of critical thinking. This is often portrayed with her intelligent comments and contributions during discussions. Her S1 was very good/excellent but I am certain she can do even better than this. She should continue with the same determination and commitment and I am certain her written work will reflect her oral and critical thinking.

Though her academic writing still needs some improvement, particularly in relation to paraphrasing, Alexia’s been making steady progress in this area as evidenced by her CW1-related homework tasks. Provided she continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity, I am confident Alexia will meet her progression requirements."
Green,"Alexia is an excellent student. She is well organised, takes notes in class and is very involved in class discussions. Her contributions to class discussions are intelligent and well thought through. I think that she could develop her confidence more and this will allow her to participate further in discussions and exercise her talents."
Amber,"Alex -  You demonstrate some command of the subject and show a strong potential, evidenced by your score recent assessment score (61%). You put in a good level of effort but do need to participate more in-class discussions and thereby be better engaged in class. Your performance on paper is good so far, but you do need to stretch yourself further. Improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary found there."
Green,"Alexia's commitment and performance have been outstanding during the first term. While she has missed some classes, when she is present she always makes elaborate notes and contributes in class. Her formative assignment was very good but I am certain she can improve."
Green,"Alexia is a real pleasure to have in class. She is a bright, intelligent and enthusiastic student, who shows a keen interest in classes. Her speaking and listening skills are very good, however, she can benefit from practising her writing skills especially organisation and argumentation. She can also dedicate some time to research to be able to find more academic and credible sources for her CW3. When she attends, she participates in all class activities and contributes to discussions. She should be attending the live sessions more regularly, though."
Green,Alexia remains an excellent student. She is well organised and is very attentive in class. Her summative 1 result reflects her capabilities and her hard work to date. She remains a little lacking in confidence and I hope that this will grow during her studies to allow her to make greater contributions to the class (and therefore develop her own understanding). I remain confident that Alexia will be very successful this year.
Green,"Alexia -  You demonstrate some command of the subject and show strong potential, evidenced by your recent assessment score (60%). You need to put  in a little more effort such as participating more in class discussions, engaging with the materials posted on Moodle and memorising the glossary shared with students in class, which will help you move forward more speedily in this last stage of the IFY."
Green,"Alexia has had some issues since moving to online teaching and learning (patchy attendance) but I believe she should not have any issues with progressing. She is a smart girl and she will be able to attain a progression mark given that she continues with the same concentration and dedication. Her S1 was good/very good, but I believe she can do much better than this."

Green,"Shiyi has made some gains in her academic studies since the beginning of her IFY programme. She continues to seek clarification for the AES assignments and demonstrates the ability to work independently and in groups. She has done well in the first two weeks of term 2 by showing continuous engagement with the course and submitting all compulsory AES tasks. This means that she has already received some valuable feedback. It is hoped that her tutor's suggestions will help Shiyi achieve higher marks for her work. Throughout the second term, Shiyi is encouraged to continue to build on her achievements and work on communication skills and level of self-confidence. She is also encouraged to express her opinions more often during class discussions. In the coming weeks, Shiyi should dedicate some time to researching her CW1 assignment topic in order to give herself a chance for a high mark."
Amber,"Shiyi is a good student. She has some good understanding of class lectures and although she does not contribute to class discussions voluntarily, when asked, she is able to answer questions intelligently. Her formative 1 work was good considering that she has some improvements to make in her english language skills. Shiyi clearly has some good understanding of the basic concepts of the course, but for her to make the most of this she needs to develop both her skill and confidence in English."
Green,"Shiyi is an excellent student. She has good attendance. She has a very strong background in maths and she always solves the question in the class without difficulty. She engages with her homework and she shows interest. If she continues like this, Shiyi will be a successful undergraduate student next year."
Amber,"Shiyi - You show significant interest in the class and so I was please to see this translated into a good score for your formative -1 assessment (60%). You need to participate more in group discussions though and build your confidence. From what I have seen, I would say your performance so far is good but you clearly have more potential and therefore need to stretch yourself further. To do this please engage in independent reading from sources such as published on Moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,"Shiyi has engaged well with the online mode of delivery in term 2. She attended her CW1 tutorial and demonstrated a positive attitude towards the AES coursework. In term 3, the student is encouraged to continue to build on her achievements and work on developing her academic speaking and presentation skills. In the coming weeks, Shiyi should dedicate some individual study time to prepare for her CW2 presentation in order to give herself a chance for a high mark."
Green,Shiyi remains a good student. She appears to have good understanding of the concepts and very successfully applied this understanding to summative 1 to achieve a very good result. In order for her to succeed overall she must now maintain the focus on her studies by regularly attending class and consistently working on the assigned tasks. If she can do this then I am optimistic that she will succeed on the course overall.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Shiyi attends the classes, but not regularly and she is not very active during the on-line sessions.Her test result was good (80%), but taking into account her previous performance, I believe that there is a scope for improvement. I would advise Shiyi to participate more in class activities and submit the homework for feedback."
Amber,"Shiyi -you show significant interest in the class, your score for summative 1 is 58%. You need to participate more in group discussions through and build your confidence. I would say for you to succeed towards progression you need to work hard to your potential. Therefore need to stretch yourself further, to do this please engage in independent reading from sources such as published on Moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook."

Green,"Altynay is a conscientious and hard-working student. She is quiet and reflective, and contributes well to class and to group discussion activities. Altynay possesses good English language skills which places her in good stead, and she has also demonstrated a good understanding of the teaching material in Term 1 and she has used it successfully in her written work. Her mock exams have overall been pleasing and I am confident that with more careful preparation and regular practice, Altyany will do very well on the IFY."
Green,"Altynay is a very good student. She is well organised, takes notes and concentrates well in class. She also contributes to class discussions very positively. Her understanding and insight is excellent and she appears to enjoy the classes. Altynay's formative 1 was good and there is still opportunity to improve this further as she practices her skills in university level study.
I am very optimistic about Altynay's future success on the course."
Amber,"Atynay - you are a pleasure to teach, you show significant interest in the class, your score for formative -1 is 62%. You put in a good level of effort in your work and are engaged in class. You need to participate more in group discussion, enhance your writing skills to meet your progression requirement. Your performance is fine but needs to stretch yourself further. To do this please engage in independent reading sources such as moodle and other sources outlined in the module handbook, putting all these efforts you can improve your score significantly"
Green,Altynay is very likely to reach progression. She is very conscientious and always prepares for the classes. Her contributions in class have been very valuable.
Green,"Altynay has managed herself fairly well and has shown a general commitment to her English studies since moving to the new mode of teaching. She has so far shown a satisfactory level of engagement and motivation in terms of carrying out her weekly MOODLE tasks, but this has tapered off in the last few weeks and I strongly encourage her to remain on top of her English studies as we near the end of term 2. I'm hoping she'll step up and focus more on her CW1 final draft, better engage in a more timely manner with his mock exams in order to be better placed for her summatives."
Green,"Altynay remains a very good student. She is very focussed and attentive in class and will engage in class discussions very well. Her contributions are intelligent and thoughtful. Her summative 1 results, whilst good relatively, was a little disappointing for a student with her talent so I am hopeful that she will continue to develop and grow during the course. I remain very confident about Altynay's future success on this course and her future studies."
Green,"Atynay - you are a pleasure to teach, you show significant interest in the class, your score for summative-1 is 70%. You put in a good level of effort in your work but you need to be better engaged in class and stretch yourself further. Improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle, follow lesson plans and memorise the glossary shared in the class. This should help you move forward more strongly, and by doing this you can improve your scores even more significantly."
Green,"Altynay's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 shows a very good progress. She has been conscientious and engaged, and submitted her homework regularly. I am confident that she will meet the progression requirements."

Green,"Hamza’s positive attitude to learning and the respect he consistently shows towards his tutors and classmates alike make him a real pleasure to teach. He takes care to participate fully in all class activities and can always be counted on to make interesting and insightful contributions to class discussions. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented him and his classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, Hamza’s performance in continuous assessment tasks to-date indicate he  has excelent understanding of the concepts taught in the AES module so far and can successfully employ a range of exam strategies. Hamza pays close attention to the feedback he receives from his tutors and is adept at turning the advice he’s given into measurable actions, as evidenced by his improved performance in CW1-related homework tasks. Provided he continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity, I am confident that Hamza will meet his progression requirements"
Green,"Hamza is an excellent student. He takes his studies seriously and is a valuable member of the class. His contributions to class discussions are intelligent and well thought through. I expect Hamza to do very well on the course overall.
He could develop further by reading more widely and exploring some other angles on the subject to satisfy his obvious interest."
Amber,"Hamza has shown good attendance. He is always interested in the class, he asks questions and he has shown that he is able to solve the questions that are asked during the class. He engages with this homework and he progresses well. I would advise Hamza to continue his hard work and he can achieve very good results in his summative assessment."
Green,"Hamza - You are a pleasure to teach. You have demonstrated a good command of the subject. You participate in class discussion and show interest in raising relevant questions. This is clearly shown in your formative-1 score, which is 70%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong and so now you need to stretch yourself further. To do this, please engage in resource on Moodle, independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook"
Green,"Hamza is a real pleasure to have in class. He always contributes to discussions and participates enthusiastically in group and pair activities. Hamza also follows his tutors` advice carefully and does some extra work if needed. His reading, speaking and listening skilla are very good but he can work on his writing skills so that he can achieve higher scores both in exam writing and CW3. For some extra materials he can refer to Moodle."
Green,Hamza remains an exemplary student. He has an obvious interest in the subject and he is highly involved in the class. He also appears organised and consistent in his approach to his studies. His summative 1 result was reflective of his capabilities and I fully expect Hamza to succeed both on this course and in his future studies. It is a pleasure to have him in the class.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Hamza has 100% attendance record, he is always ready for the lessons, he is very active during the on-line classes, and he submitted a few homeworks. His test result of 90% reflects his hard work. I would advise Hamza to continue his good work and continue to submit the homework regularly for feedback."

Amber,"Attia demonstrates a genuine concern for learning and approaches given tasks with a sincere desire to succeed. She has done well in the first two weeks of term 2 by attending online sessions, showing continuous engagement with the course and submitting all compulsory AES tasks. She should continue working on her paraphrasing and referencing skills, and take on board the feedback she has received so far. It is recommended that Attia dedicates some time over the coming weeks to independent study using resources on Moodle and mock exams on StudySmart , both of which are likely to help her achieve her academic study goals."
Green,"Attia is a very good student. She takes her studies seriously and concentrates well in class in general. She takes notes and contributes to class discussions. However there are times when her understanding is lacking and she needs to address this through more consistent study, for example, by following up classes with independent reading. Her formative 1 result was a little bit disappointing although in relation to the rest of the class it was good. I believe that with some more work and more experience Attia will improve her skill and go on to succeed on the course overall."
Amber,Attia has great attendance in maths. She always participates and she interested in the class. Her results in the formative assessment was not representative of her work in the class. For this reason I would advise her to work and practise more with her homework. This will give her more confidence when she will be asked to write an exam next time. With hard work Attia can have a good grade in maths.
Green,"Attia- You are a pleasure to teach, are actively engaged in class and do participate in the class discussions too.You have demonstrated a good command of the subject. Your formative-1 score was 75%, which is an excellent score. Keep up the good work and engage in independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources published on Moodle and in your module handbook."
Green,"Attia has shown a positive attitude towards learning in general and also towards her AES coursework. Her level of engagement with the course has been good. The student knows from her tutorials that she should continue working on her paraphrasing and referencing skills, and take on board the feedback she has received so far. It is recommended that Attia dedicates some time over the coming weeks to independent study using resources on the Moodle and completing the mock exams available on the WISEflow platform, which will help her better prepare for her summative assessment."
Green,Attia is a very good student who is sincere and hard working. She has good attendance and generally engages well in class. She can improve her learning experience in class by engaging more in classroom discussions to get the most from the sessions. Her summative 1 result was very good and this is reflective of Attia's capability and hard work. I am very optimistic about Attia's prospects on the course overall and expect her to do very well.
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Attia attendance is good, she is working in classes, she is always in contact with tutor. Her test result of 72% was reasonably good. I recommend to continue to work regularly, do more exercises at home and send the homework for feedback. I believe that Attia has a potential to achieve even better results in her S2 assessment."
Green,"Attia- You are a pleasure to teach, are actively engaged in class and do participate in the class discussions too. You have demonstrated a good command of the subject.

Amber,"Although Whitney is a quiet individual, she enjoys sharing her ideas and concerns with her classmates in small group discussions. In term 1, she has made some gains in her academic studies. Whitney continues to seek clarification for her assignments and demonstrates the ability to work independently and in groups. Throughout the second term, Whitney is encouraged to continue to build on her achievements and work on communication skills and level of self-confidence. She is also encouraged to express her opinions more often during class discussions."
Green,"You have done well this term, setting yourself up with very good foundation for your Summative Assignment. You have clearly worked hard and have a good mark for your Formative Assignment, so well done. However, you are very quiet in class, though you are more vocal in groups. Try and participate more in class as it will help you develop as a student as the course goes on."
Green,"Whitney is a strong student with great potential. She has demonstrated great commitment to her studies and is an active member of our class. I am confident that Whitney will do very well and needs only to work a little harder on her written English, something she ran into trouble with in her early formative assessment. Nonetheless, I have full faith in her capability and believe she will perform strongly in the first summative assessment a few weeks from now. My biggest advice to Whitney is that she must showcase her learning in this subject through the successful use of film and media terminology, and awareness of broader interaction of media texts with audiences and society at large. She must focus on the learning outcomes and ensure these are fully met."
Amber,Yuxun has done a lot of effort for Sociology. She is quiet in class but is able to answer any questions I pose at her. Her formative has been good but she is able to do better than that.
Green,"In term 2, Whitney has participated well in the AES live classes and engaged well with the online delivery mode. This allowed the student to stay on top of her assignments and meet the requirements of the module. It is crucial that Whitney continues to seek clarification and ask her AES tutors any questions she might have. In term 3, Whitney is encouraged to continue to build on her achievements and work on her presentation skills as well as her academic writing skills. These skills will be crucial for CW2 summative presentation and CW3 extended researched essay, both of which are due in term 3."
Green,"You have been working hard recently - and for that you should be commended: well done! Your Summative 1 was a very good piece of work and your work in class has also been strong. You have taken to the online classroom well, and you have started to make insightful contributions to discussions (using the chat box) which is a step forward from when we were in person. You should be pleased at this point! Your next step is to keep this up: you need to focus on your next assessments to be assured of success in the Arts module."
Green,"Whitney has done moderately well in summative 1. However, I feel there is more that Whitney can achieve and summative 2 is an opportunity for her to show this. Whitney needs to work harder and use the model answer for s2 to really understand what this assessment is asking of students. She needs to plan and be ready share her early drafts with me so that she can be sure she is on the right track. Finally, a stronger proof read and consulting her AES tutors via a drop in clinic may help the final product."
Amber,Yuxun has performed well in her S1 but she has been attending workshops and tutorials the last 2 weeks to help her improve her mark in a RESIT. I believe she will be able to attain a progression mark if she continues showing dedication and commitment.

Green,"Mohammad is a bright, intelligent young man, whose contributions to class discussions are highly valued by his peers and tutors alike. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented him and his classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, Mohammad’s performance in continuous assessment tasks to date indicate he has a  very good understanding of the concepts taught in the AES module so far and can successfully employ a range of exam strategies. Though his academic writing still needs some improvement, particularly in relation to paraphrasing and referencing accurately, Mohammad’s been making steady progress in this area and, provided he continues working with the same degree of dedication and integrity, I am confident that he will meet his progression requirements in the AES module."
Green,Mohammad is a very good student. He had excellent results in formative 1 and his contributions in class are intelligent and useful. He participates well in class and is polite to me and his fellow pupils. I expect Mohammad to succeed on the course if he continues this approach.
Green,"Mohammad - You are a pleasure to teach. You have demonstrated a good command of the subject. You participate in class discussion and show interest in raising questions relevant to the topics being studied. This is clearly shown in your formative 1 score, which is 70%. You put in a commendable level of effort in your work and are fully engaged in class. Your performance is strong and now needs to go even further. To do this, please engage in Moodle, independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Green,"Mohammad is a very promising boy, having all the capabilities to attain a progression mark. He has been good in terms of attendance but can improve on this. His participation in class also shows that he is a very critical boy. His formative was in the range of 60 but I am certain he will be able to progress."
Green,"Mohammed is a real pleasure to have in class. He is a bright, intelligent and enthusiastic student. Mohammed usually participates in class activities and contributes to discussions. His reading, speaking and listening skills are quite good but he can practise his writing, especially his paraphrasing and organisation skills, which will be required for CW3.  He can refer to the materials and short lectures on Moodle to practise his writing skills."
Green,"Mohammad continues to perform well on the course. He has lost a little focus due to the distance learning changes, but overall he is a talented and motivated student. His summative 1 result was reflective of his capabilities and work to date, although I do believe that he could perform better with greater attention to his studies. I remain confident that Mohammad will have a very successful year at Royal Holloway and will succeed in his further studies."
Green,"Mohammad - You are a pleasure to teach. You have demonstrated a good command of the subject. You are participating in class discussion and showing interest in raising questions relevant to the topics being studied. Your summative 1 score was 65%, which is lower than your formative score but still respectable. Your performance is therefore fine but since you have more potential (as evidenced by your formative result) you need to go even further. To do this, please engage with information and activities on Moodle, independent reading from reputable sources such as The Economist and other sources outlined in the module handbook."
Amber,"While Mohammad is a very intelligent and commited boy, he has not managed to perform to an adequate level for his S1. As he admitted himself, he did not pay attention much to his S1 and this is reflected also in his mark. He needs to show more dedication in preparing his Summative works in order to attain a progression mark; he is more than able of doing so."

Green,"I am very pleased with the progress being made in the AES course by Jose. He is fully focused on the content, when present, and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Jose has achieved above 60% in overall grades, which is above the English language requirement for his chosen degree and it is a good result for this term. I am sure he will continue to make progress with his positive attitude. However, he is advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard."
Green,"You have worked very hard in Arts this term and this has paid off with an excellent assignment grade - well done. You should be very pleased. You take a proactive approach in class, working hard to participate in group work and class discussion, and make insightful contributions - both in terms of answers and more questions! Next term, you need to ensure you remain focused and if you carry on as you have been, this should give you a very solid foundation for Summative 1."
Green,"You have made an excellent start in Music. You are not only committed to the subject, but make thoughtful and insightful contributions in class. Your assignment, too, showed a depth of thought that was impressive. For next term, carry on working hard, improve your punctuality (!), and you should see the rewards of this, not only in your assignment, but more generally."
Green,"Jose is hands down one of the most talented students in this cohort. 

He has a critical mind and he seems to have taken an interest in the subjects we have been discussing and applying them to his own interests.

His paticipation and effort are excellent while his assessment was excellent as well."
Green,"I am very pleased with Jose's attitude and the progress he has made in the AES module. He is fully focused on the content when present and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Jose has achieved above 70% in overall grades, which is well above the English language requirement for his chosen degree, which is an excellent result for this term. I am sure he will continue to make progress with his good learning attitude. Last but not least, Jose should ensure to complete homework after class."
Green,"Your participation in Arts continues to be excellent: thoughtful, insightful and pertinent. You read texts intelligently and question them well. Your Summative 1 was excellent. However, you did not submit your second Formative Assignment, which as we have already discussed, is problematic. You need to work on the consistency of your work: while your work is excellent when I see it, I need to see it for every deadline!"
Green,"You are a dedicated student in music, showing that you read around the subject and you understand what is required of you. You participate freely and with meaningful and insightful comments, so well done. Your marks for both your Summative 1 and Formative 2 were strong, so you have a good basis for Summative 2 as you have developed your writing skills in relation to music as well as reflecting on practical skills. Overall, you should be pleased, but to ensure success you need to maintain your focus during this time of transition."
Green,"Jose is undoubtedly one of the best students in this cohort. While his determination and commitment were a bit off during the second term, I have no doubt he will be able to attain the progression mark."

Green,"Angelina welcomes new tasks and seeks new opportunities for learning, especially, when this involves group work. She has demonstrated a positive attitude towards learning and shown excellent leadership skills. She has successfully taken advantage of all the learning opportunities that the AES course has had to offer this term. She has worked hard throughout the term and greatly contributed to the positive class atmosphere. It is recommended that Angelina dedicates some time during her winter break to researching her CW1 in order to give herself a head start on researching her chosen topic in Term 2."
Green,"All term you have shown yourself to be a dedicated and conscientious student in Arts. You have worked hard, participating actively in class and group discussions and this has paid off with your assignment mark, which is very good. Not only that, but you have completed homework in a timely manner - as well as engaging fully with tasks requiring a greater depth of research. Nonetheless, there are points which you can build on for your summative assignment, which we can discuss in your tutorial. All in all, you should be very pleased with your term's work!"
Green,Angelina is a very committed and talented student who has shown great promise in this first term. Her formative assessment results were excellent and showcased her potential. I look forward to her summative 1 results which I feel will again show great promise. My advice to Angelina is to continue to revise her notes and raise the level of her critical thinking even more.
Green,"Angelina probably has the most sociological mind in this cohort even if she claims to not enjoy sociology as much.

She is a young woman with bags of potential and she is well on her way to fullfill them. She is not just extremely studious; she is also very critical, keeps tidy notes, puts enormous amounts of effort and is generally excellent in class.

It is a pleasure having her as a student."
Green,"Angelina is a self-motivated student who is committed to doing her best. She has incredible self-discipline and always gets her work done in a timely manner. She responds well to what has been read or discussed in class and as homework. Angelina tackles classroom assignments, tasks, and group work in an organised manner. She expresses her ideas clearly, both verbally and through writing. What is more, she can make a logical and persuasive argument. During group work, she can be depended on to do what she is asked to do. She makes group collaboration straightforward as she offers constructive suggestions to peers to enhance their work. Not only that, she also accepts the recommendations of her peers and acts on them when appropriate. In a group seminar, Angelina enhances group discussion through her insightful comments. Angelina is well on her way to achieving the required progression mark of 70% in Writing and passing the IFY programme."
Green,"You have worked very hard all year and this is really starting pay off now. Your marks for both Summative 1 and Formative 2 were very strong, so well done. You have laid excellent foundations for Summative 2 and you have the tools to be successful in the coming term. You work hard in class - though have participated less in lectures - and now you have the opportunity for this to come together in Summative 2. Carry on engaging with the primary texts and the secondary literature to be successful for your final assignment."
Green,Angelina is an exceptional student with great potential. She has demonstrated great commitment to her studies and is an active member of our class. I am confident that Angelina will do very well and wish her the very best for her final assessment a few weeks from now. Angelina knows that my door is always open and I am pleased that she is not backwards in coming forward to seek clarity and guidance! Well done Angelina.
Green,Angelina is a brilliant student and I am certain she will be progressing easily to Undergraduate degree.  She is one of the most talented students in this cohort and we can expect great things from her in the future.

Zahra can benefit from dedicating some time to research over the winter break so that she can get a head start on coursework portfolio. She should mainly focus on finding suitable sources for her coursework questions and checking their credibility."
Green,86% formative 1 result.  Zahra has performed well in class and in this assessment.  She is a good student and an example to her peers.
Green,"Zhara's level of attendance has been excellent and so has her participation in class.

She seems to be putting a commendable effort in her studies and making very good progress. 

Her assessment results have been very good but I believe she can even improve on that by a lot."
Green,"Zhara's levels of attendance and participation have been excellent.

She seems to be putting effort into studying and this will be rewarded.

While her assessment was not as good as I would have hoped, I am confident she will be able to achieve much more in her future assignments."
Green,"Zahra shows a keen interest in learning and usually completes her tasks in time successfully. She is a bright and diligent student. Although she has got good marks in all areas, reviewing the class materials on moodle will help her in term 3. Zahra can also dedicate some time to do mock exams, which can be found on Moodle."
Green,Summative 1 result 87%.  Zahra's results are consistently high and she will have no problem achieving success in this subject.  Zahra always engages with the problem solving in class and independently and discusses the maths concepts with her peers.  Well done Zahra
Green,I have no worries about Zhara's ability to progress. Her level of participation and commitment have been consistently extremely high and I am certain she will do great at undergraduate level as well.

You work well in groups, in a focussed and mature manner. You are, however, a bit quieter in lectures - this is something for you to work on in the New Year. Your assignment showed how hard you have been working - well done. All in all, you have an excellent foundation to build on and you should be very pleased."
Green,"Anna has had an excellent level of attendance. 

I believe she can improve a bit more in her participation in class.

I do believe that she put a commendable effort in her studies and that is something that was obvious through her assessment results that were excellent."
Green,"Anna is an excellent student, with excellent attendance and work ethic. 

She can improve a bit on her participation in class though. 

She seems to be putting a lot of effort in her studying and this is reflected in her assessment results."
Green,"Anna has established goals for her academic achievement and is working diligently to attain them. She has made good progress in many areas of her academic studies over the past two terms. Anna shares her ideas and research skills in preparing for group presentations and is a co-operative, responsible individual. Careful planning and a conscientious attitude are positive aspects of her class participation and behaviour. She consistently scores nearly 80% for writing in the continuous formative assessment (79% in the last mock exam before the break). She is responsive to feedback and builds positive relationships with her peers and tutors. What is more, Anna has made noticeable progress in terms of her reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where she was awarded a mark of 95%. Anna is to be congratulated on her achievements and encouraged to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout term 3."
Green,"You have worked very hard over the last couple of terms and this has really paid off. Your marks have been excellent and you are in a very strong position for the final part of the course: both your Summative 1 and Formative 2 show the results of your endeavours. Although you are slightly quiet in class, you still make insightful and accurate contributions. You should carry on working hard for success next term. Overall, you should be very pleased indeed."
Green,"For me Anna is one of the most promising students in this cohort, and I can see her going all the way to doctoral studies. Her level of commitment to learning is astonishing and I will not be surprised if she attains top marks in this cohort."
Green,"As I have mentioned in a different report, Anna for me is one of the most talented if not the most talented students in this cohort. We can expect great things from her in the future."

Green,"Although Estelle is a quiet individual, she enjoys sharing her ideas and concerns with her classmates in small group discussions. This term, she has made some gains in her academic studies. Estelle continues to seek clarification for her assignments and demonstrates the ability to work independently and in groups. Throughout the second term, Estelle is encouraged to continue to build on her achievements and work on communication skills and level of self-confidence. She is also encouraged to express her opinions more often during class discussions. It is recommended for Estelle to dedicate some time during her winter break to researching her CW1 in order to give herself a head start on researching the topic in Term 2."
Green,"You have worked hard this term - well done. Disappointingly, your assignment received a deduction because it was too long - please be careful of this next time. However, the fundamental work behind your assignment was very good and there is plenty for you to build on next term, so well done. You make intelligent and meaningful contributions to class discussions, both in seminars and lectures. In order to continue to be successful next term, you should continue to engage in classes and with the texts."
Green,"Estelle's level of attendance has been good but there is room for improvement. 

Her participation is very good but there is room for improvement. 

She seems to be putting very good effort in her studies and she seems to be making very good progress in her knowledge and understanding. 

Her assessments have been really good but there is still room for improvement."
Green,"I have no doubt that Estelle will be progressing. She is a very talented young woman and has a very critical mind. 

She however has to work a bit on her attendance as she has missed some classes.

Her level of participation has been excellent and seems to be putting a lot of effort in her studying.

While her result was not expected, I have no doubt she will be improving on it."
Green,"Estelle has established goals for her academic achievement and is working diligently to attain them. She is responsive to feedback and builds positive relationships with her peers and tutors. Estelle has made good progress in many areas of her academic studies over the past two terms. She worked hard in term 2 in order to improve her writing skills and managed to achieve a mark of 66% in the last writing mock exam taken before the spring break.

Both your Summative 1 and your Formative 2 are very good, giving you a  strong foundation for Term 3 and Summative 2. You should continue to engage with the primary texts and secondary literature, as well as participating in class discussion, in order to ensure success next term. Overall, you should be pleased."
Green,"Estelle has had some issues with her attendance during term 2 but she was able to perform very good in her S1 resit. 
I am confident that she will be able to attain a progression mark easily."
Green,"As I have wrote for psychology, I have no worries for Estelle's progression. She has had some issues with her attendance levels but she seemed to be picking up towards the end of the term. If she continues with the same determination and commitment she will easily progress."

Green,"Stepahanie shows a keen interest to learn and usually completes her tasks in time. Although she has got good marks in all areas, reviewing the class materials on moodle will help her in term too. Also, Stephanie should dedicate some time to research over the winter break so that she can have a head  start, She can focus on finding suitable sources and checking their credibility."
Green,"You have worked very hard in Arts this term and it has really paid off with an excellent formative assignment grade. This gives you an excellent foundation for your summative work next term. You have also worked very hard in class, both in groups and in class discussions. All of this has really come out in your contributions which are insightful and meaningful - well done. Next term, you should carry on working like this to ensure you continue to be successful on this module."
Green,"Stephanie is a committed and eager student who has shown great promise in this first term. Although her formative assessment results did not reflect her full potential, I am confident she has understood what she needs to do in summative 1 to improve her grade. I am sure that with continued dedication, Stephanie will pass and progress in this subject. My advice to Stephanie is to continue to revise and aim to show her learning in clearer and more explicit terms."
Green,"Stephanie's level of attendance and participation have been excellent. 

She seems to be putting a very good amount of effort in her studies and I have no doubt she can achieve a lot in her studies. 

She seems to have shown interest in Sociology and this is reflected also in her learning abilities and assessment result."
Green,Stephannie is an active and bright student who usually comes prepared to class and contributes to discussions. She attends the classes regularly and submits her assignmnents in time. She is good at both pair work and group work. She can review materials of term 1 and term 2 on Moodle and refer to Mock exams on Moodle for some extra practice.
Green,"You work hard in Arts. You now have a very strong mark for Summative 1 and you go into Summative 2 with a solid basis from Formative 2, so well done. You participate well in class and your observations are pertinent and astute. In order to ensure that you are successful for your final term of the course, you should continue to engage with the primary texts and a wide variety of secondary literature to give you a basis to write your final assignment."
Green,"Stephanie is a wonderful student with great potential. She has demonstrated great commitment to her studies and is an active member of our class. I am confident that Stephanie will do very well and needs only to think harder about how best communicate her vision in visual terms, something she ran into trouble with in her early formative assessment. Nonetheless, I have full faith that she has learnt from this since and will perform strongly in the final assessment a few weeks from now."
Green,Stephanie has continued with where she left of during the 1st term. Her attendance and participation continue to be top and her assignment was excellent as well.

Green,"Asim has been a real pleasure to teach: polite, attentive and driven, he participates fully in all class activities and makes interesting and thoughtful contributions to academic discussions. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented him and his classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, Asim’s performance in the mock assessments throughout the term indicates he has a  good understanding of the concepts taught in the AES module so far and can successfully employ a range of exam strategies. That said, there is still some room for improvement in Asim’s performance, particularly in terms of academic writing. Provided he does this, I have no doubt whatsoever that Asim will be in position to meet his AES progression requirements."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment. Asim’s understanding of the material is quite good, he is attending regularly and practice at home. He got 92% in his first test. Well done! No problems whatsoever."
Green,"Asim has shown great interest in the Physics class. His attendance is very good. 
He engages in the class, he is able to solve problems and always tries to find the answers to the questions. Asim prepared a very good lab report and he showed that he understands what are the important elements in a report. If Asim continues like this in Physics will have great results."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance in class and results of the first assessment (98%). Asim is doing great. He is working in classe and at home, asks questions, helps other students in his group. I am sure he will achieve the highest overall result."
Green,"Asim has a positive attitude to learning and respects his tutors and classmates, which makes the sessions a real pleasure. He always contributes to discussions and class activities enthusiastically. His reading, speaking and listening skills are very good but he can improve his academic writing, practising paraphrasing and summarising skills. He can refer to Moodle, where he can find some extra materials such as short lectures or exam practice."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the second formative assessment. Asim understanding of statistics is quite good, his test result was 100%. I recommend to submit the Applied Mathematics homework more regularly in order to get a feedback."
Green,"Asim is a great student that has interest in physics and a good understanding of maths and physics. He always attends the class, he engages with this homework and he participates. Asim has a rational understanding and he understands what is asked from him. He is a student that can progress successfully with this attitude."
Green,"These comments are based on the student's performance and results of the first summative assessment. Asim understanding of the material is very good, he attends regularly, pays attention in class and submits homework. This good work resulted in his excellent performance in test with 92% result."

Green,"Hiba is a real pleasure to have in class. Bright, intelligent and highly-driven, she is not afraid to question concepts taught in the AES module to further her learning and deepen her understanding of the principles of academic English. She can always be counted on to make interesting and insightful contributions to all class discussions and helps to create a positive learning environment in both virtual and face-to-face settings. While the covid-19 pandemic prevented Hiba and her classmates from taking the formal formative examinations at the end of Term 1, her performance in the mock assessments throughout the term indicates she has a very firm grasp on the principles of Academic English. The two areas Hiba still needs to work on are paraphrasing and finding appropriate academic support for her claims. That said, she is making steady progress in this area and, if she continues working hard, I am sure she will meet AES progression requirements."
Green,"You are an engaged student, though self-discipline does not always come easily to you. You need to learn to focus on the matter at hand - and work on not being distracted. However, you do try to ask insightful questions and contribute to class discussions as well as group work. Your Formative Assignment was very good, meaning that you have a solid foundation for your Summative Assignment next term. Overall, you should be pleased."
Green,Hiba is a very good student who very often contributes to our discussions. Her formative assignment was also very good. I believe she will easily progress.
Green,Hiba seems to be understanding the course material and she often engages in discussion in class. I have no worries over her progression at this point.
Green,"Hiba`s positive attitude to learning and the respect she consistently shows towards her tutors and classmates alike make her a real pleasure to teach. She takes care to participate fully in all class activities and can always be counted on to make interesting contributions to class discussions. She can work on her writing skills, especially paraphrasing and summarising, outside the live sessions. Hiba can also refer to Moodle and library for her research skills, which is required for CW3."
Green,"You are an engaged and motivated student, and this is reflected in your Summative 1 mark - well done. You have shown commitment through the transition to online learning, which has stood you in good stead for the final part of the course. You take a vocal and active part in classes, answering questions and asking others, showing that you have not only engaged with the texts, but are also conscientious. There is much for you to be pleased with here - keep it up!"
Green,"Hiba did excellently in S1. She has shown determination and focus in her studies and I am certain she will progress to undergraduate level. She needs to continue with the same rhythm, focus and concentration. She should aim to make the small improvements needed via tutorials with her tutors, because she certainly has the ability to achieve a lot."
Green,"Hiba seems to understand all concepts and ideas we are discussing and she contributes to discussions as well. Her S1 was very good/excellent but had issues with plagiarism which brought her mark down. Following a tutorial with her, she seems to have understood how to improve on her mark. I have no worries over her progression, given she continues with the same dedication and commitment."

Green,"Ghazal is a conscientious individual who has established goals for her academic achievement and is working diligently to attain them. She has experienced good progress in many areas of her academic study this term. She shares her ideas and research skills in preparing for group presentations and is a co-operative, responsible individual. Careful planning and a conscientious attitude are positive aspects of her class participation and behaviour. Ghazal is to be congratulated on her achievements and encouraged to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout Term 2."
Green,Ghazal is a very good student who takes her studies seriously. She takes notes in classes and concentrates well during classes and lectures. Her formative 1 was very good and I believe that this will continue to improve as she develops her understanding and skill. Ghazal could develop herself through contributing more during class discussions and therefore exercising her knowledge to develop it further. I am very optimistic that Ghazal will do very well on the course overall.
Green,"Ghazal - You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate some command of the subject and this is clear from your most recent assessment score, which was 65%, You put in a good level of effort in your work but you need to be better engaged in class and stretch yourself further. Improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle and memorise the glossary shared with all students in the class. This should help you move forward more strongly, and by doing this you can improve your scores even more significantly."
Green,Ghazal has had an excellent record of attendance and she performed well in her formative assignment as well. I have no worries over her progression at this time.
Green,"Ghazal's participation in the AES live classes in term 2 has been good. In term 3, the student should make the most of the mock exams available on the WISEflow platform in order to familiarise herself with the online exam format before her summative exams in June. Ghazal should also set some time aside to start working on her CW2 summative presentation as well as CW3 extended researched essay which are due in term 3."
Green,"Ghazal remains a very good student. She is able to understand concepts and apply these in class discussions.  She appears well organised and is able to focus on her studies. Her summative 1 result was very good, but I believe that she is able to produce work of a higher standard going forward if she puts her mind to it."
Green,"Ghazal -  You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate a good command of the subject and this is clear from your summative 1 assessment score, which was 72%, You put in a good level of effort in your work but you need to be better engaged in class and stretch yourself further. Improve this by reading the materials posted on Moodle, follow lesson plans and memorise the glossary shared with all students in the class. This should help you move forward more strongly, and by doing this you can improve your scores even more significantly."
Green,Ghazal has had a bit of a patchy attendance lately due to personal issues but nevertheless she managed to pull off an excellent S1 result. What she needs to do from now on is to try and focus/concentrate more on her studies as she is a very capable student who can accomplish much in her academic future.
