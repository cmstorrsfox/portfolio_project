Amber,"Andrew is currently being held back by the time difference, which means he cannot attend classes. This will become increasingly important as the course goes on. He is clearly highly capable and could do well in AES."
Green,Good engagement both synchronously and asynchronously since you started attending lectures and seminars.
Pink,Chun is a quiet student and I am concerned that he is not making sufficient progress. He is unable to contribute to class discussions and he is also unable to answer questions when asked. I think that this is most ikely due to his lack of sufficient skill in English. Chun should consider how to approach his studies next term and recognise that he will need to increase his energy if he is to succeed.
Green,Great improvement in your attendance at synchronous activities since the last RPAG although you are sometimes constrained by time differences.
Green,Your engagement and efforts towards achieving your best have been impressive.

Amber,"Attendance is an issue with Andrew and even though he has moved back to Hong Kong he is still regularly missing AES sessions.In terms of his work, I feel that Andrew is clearly capable of progression, and he produced a particularly well- thought out CW1 assignment.
Please attend all AES sessions from now on."
Amber,Your moodle engagement and engagement when you are in class have been good but you need to improve on your attendance because you have the opportunity to interact with your tutor and classmates during synchronous activities.
Red,"Chun doesn't complete the work expected and progression is not guaranteed. At this rate I am very concerned that Chun will not succeed and this would be a shame as he has the potential to do well, but is letting himself down by being very disengaged. It is vital that as we come closer to the first summative in this module, Chun is mindful of how he is organising his time to ensure he has plenty of opportunity to ask for help and not be late in submitting his work."
Green,Very good performance in this module. Keep it up.
Green,Good performance in this module. Keep it up.
Green,Andrew is a proactive student in this module and is keen on learning marketing theories. Andrew needs to carry the same enthusiasm throughout the semester in order achieve high grades.
Amber,"Andrew is a regular student who works well in groups. However, Andrew needs to put in some more effort in being active in class during discussions, as this will help him understand the topics better and gain multiple perspectives."
Green,Very good performance in this module. Well done.

Pink,"Ahmed worked hard and completed his AES tasks with high percentages on the AES platform after he had the access to it in Week 5. However, given the high entry requirements from RHUL, he needs to improve his seminar skills, listening skills and written work. Furthermore, he needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on the AES platform are likely to improve chances of progression."
Pink,"Ahmed is a slightly unusual student. In class he appears to be concentrating and seems able to answer questions when asked, but he has not submitted his formative coursework. This is normally the indication of a student who is having problems. He is also a little patchy with his attendance.

I arranged a tutorial with him to discuss this, but he did not come to the appointment. Perhaps he is having difficulty organising his time and this will be fixed as he learns how to manage his studies, but it is concerning at this stage of the course."
Amber,"Ahmed - You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrated a good command of the subject in your formative assessment scoring well overall (68%). To continue improving you should keep on top of all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorising the glossary from the Kortext textbook and engage in independent reading. This will help you secure your score and progress."
Amber,"Ahmed's submission for Formative 1 and early homeworks showed a good progress in relation to the subject-specfic knowledge and analytical skills. However, his attendance has become patchy recently and a few assignments have not been submitted or submitted late (including the Formative 1). While I saw a lot of progress in the written assessments, his class contributions have been rather scarce. I recommend him to study regularly and a more organised and disciplined approach to the tasks."
Red,"Ahmed could complete much of the weekly AES asynchronous tasks on the AES online platform. However, he was not engaging in class as he seemed not to understand well in class. He missed the writing mock exam, both summative seminars A and B and one-to-one meeting with the HoE and his AES tutor. He didn’t submit the CW1 planning document on Moodle. His AES marks so far are all below the pass mark of 40.

He needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing independent learning materials on the AES platform are likely to improve chances of progression. It is also imperative that he attends AES drop-In sessions on a regular basis."
Green,"Ahmed has had a good year so far with good results in his assignments that show that he is making good progress. He remains quiet in class and finds it difficult to answer questions when asked, so he should think about developing this area as a means to improving his learning experience even further."
Amber,"Ahmed  - You are good student. Your attendance started off a little patchy this term but you have explained the reason for why this was. Missing classes however, can affect your score, but despite this, your summative assessment score is quite good at 65%. To keep this up and improve it even further, you need to concentrate more on your studies and continue actively finishing all the asynchronous activities on Moodle. Try to use subject-specific-vocabulary in your work, and be conscious of how this vocabulary is used in any independent reading you undertake."
Green,"Ahmed's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 has shown a lot of progress and reflected his hard work and commitment to improve his knowledge and understanding of Politics. He displayed very good research skills at this level and very good analytical skills. The grade obtained for this assessment places him at the top of his class. I recommend that he keeps up the great work, and advise him to engage more during the online sessions and to work closer with his colleagues."
Pink,"Ahmed has completed his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate this term. However, his overall grades are well below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. He is advised to follow the study plan suggested by his AES tutor and Head of English and have regular updates with them on this. Attend writing and listening workshops is also recommended. Being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,"Ahmed is often quiet in class - he does not normally participate in class discussions or ask questions. He also finds it difficult to answer questions when he is asked directly in class. However, his summative 1 mark was good and he always appears to be focussed on the class material when in class. In spite of my concerns he appears to be making good progress and needs to maintain this performance going forward."
Green,"Ahmed - You are a good student and this is reflected in your summative assessment score (65%). To keep up and improve your scores, my advice is for you to engage more consistently with the asynchronous actives on Moodle. Try to identify subject-specific terms while doing independent reading and include these more forcefully in your assignments."
Green,"Ahmed's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 showed a good improvement in writing, analytical and research skills. He is conscientious and hardworking and has always submitted his homework and asynchronous activities on time. Whilst his class engagement has improved significantly in the last weeks, I advise him to try to engage more actively in class and at times to take the lead on various activities. I also recommend that he takes the time during the spring break to make sure that he is on top of the readings and to start revising for the summative assessment 2."
Pink,"Ahmed demonstrates good learning attitudes when present in class. However, he shows a limited understanding of the concepts introduced so far. He has scored well below 40% in his writing exam, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. He missed all the summative reading, listening and speaking exams as well as the meetings with the HoE and me on his study plan. He should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. Attending live sessions, speaking more English, doing extensive listening, reading and writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. It is also imperative that he attends all the AES workshops on a regular basis."
Green,Ahmed has slightly improved his engagement in class and will now contribute to class discussions more freely. His second formative assessment was good although I do occasionally question his focus in class. Overall Ahmed appears to be improving gradually and making good progress.
Green,
Amber,"Even though Ahmed's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 showed a good improvement in writing, analytical and research skills, his submission for Formative 2 was rather weak. He was advised to re-write one of the essay topics and submit it by the end of the spring holidays, a task which he misread and consequently didn't complete. He is conscientious and hardworking and has always submitted his homework and asynchronous activities on time. However, he needs to keep up the good work in order to maintain his very good grades in Politics."

Red,
Red,No classes attended!
Pink,
Amber,
Red,"You have shown an improvement in attendance towards the end of the term as well as your interaction with the AES platform study site. This is good and I hope you continue to improve this next term. No completion of mock exams combined with low attendance in class mean it is difficult for me to have a clear idea of your abilities. From hearing you speak, I think you can communicate well in English, but you need to participate more in the live sessions. Overall, you have the potential to do well, but your teachers need to see it."
Pink,"Hamza needs to fully engage in synchronous and asynchronous activities.  In addition, he must be seen to be taking part with the other students in class.  He achieved 52% in the formative 1 assessment, although this could have been improved if the last question had been completed.  If Hamza is to benefit from this second year repeating the course, he must be determined to improve and actively work hard giving time to independent study."
Pink,"Hamza is able, friendly and polite student. However, these attributes alone would not be enough to see through him for the purposes of completing the module and pass it. appears to be online most of the sessions, however not very engaging. At times, I was unable to get responses from him as his video was muted but audio was on. I made him aware of this, and he promptly apologised and promised that he would mend his ways in the coming term. He would definitely benefit from 1:1 intervention on summatives. He must also engage more during his lessons. I suggest he now focus on the summative tasks with the view to passing the module and progress."
Amber,"To establish the perspective of being on track to progress to the university, you would need to practice more and engage more in self study. My advice would be to better manage your time. It is very important that you're active in class to cover topics, but also manage time at home so you have time for revision."
Red,
Amber,
Green,
Green,
Red,"Hamza always needs reminders and encouragement to begin tasks in class. He continues to have difficulty with completing homework assignments and engaging with the AES Online platform. Hamza must work on improving his academic skills and must attend the workshops recommended to him. The student did not take part in the summative seminar or AES exams (reading & writing) and therefore he consistently scores a mark of 0% in AES. To improve his marks, Hamza must complete independent study tasks on AES Online every week as well as the mock exam practice set by his tutor. He must also remember to put the dates and times of his AES assessments in his calendar."
Green,"Hamza is more capable than he demonstrates and needs to have more belief in himself.  With a little effort he could achieve so much more.  Hamza must ensure he works to deadlines to avoid penalties for late submission.  

Hamza must not sit back whilst waiting for the summative 2 submission, he needs to complete his research and present it in an interesting and meaningful manner."
Pink,"Your attendance for physics is very low meaning that you have been missing a lot of your physics classes. This needs to be improved. You do not participate in the class discussions and usually do not send any answers. I expect you to be more active in the class, solve the questions and discuss your answers. You missed your F2 which was an opportunity for both you and me as your tutor to see your progress during the spring term. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle."
Amber,"Your attendance for Pure maths is very low, and you rarely participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by your tutor. Your S1- resit is 66% which shows you need to work harder for your S2. You also missed your F2 which was an opportunity for both you and me as your tutor to see your progress during the spring term. You need to try very hard for your S2. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for S2. Also, you need to attend maths workshops to be ready for the S2."

Red,"Khalid seems to be completely disinterested in the course. It is difficult to comment on his performance, as his attendance has been so sporadic. In order to improve Khalid must attend all classes and complete assignments and homework or it will be very difficult for him to pass the course."
Red,"I am very concerned about your progress in this module. You have missed more than half of our lessons (Attendance 44%). You are not attending the workshops although they are mandatory for you. Your engagement with Moodle is next to none and you have missed all of your assignments and quizzes and your performance in summative assessments 1 and 2 is not satisfactory at all. You are constantly distracted during the class, and neither take participate in class discussions nor can answer any questions during the session. You must not miss any more sessions, should start working very hard and need to be serious about your assignments and quizzes. You need to review all of the missed sessions and try to catch up to speed. Moreover, you should not miss any of the workshops as they are currently mandatory for you."
Red,"I am very concerned about your progress in this module. You have missed most of our lessons (Attendance 17%). You are not attending the workshops although they are mandatory for you.

You must not miss any more sessions, should start working very hard and need to be serious about your assignments and quizzes. You need to review all of the missed sessions and try to catch up to speed. Moreover, you should not miss any of the workshops as they are currently mandatory for you."
Pink,"Khalid: your attendance is poor and you're missing a lot of content. You have to understand that there are things you can't teach yourself. You are not engaged in class activities. Your attendance is critical for you to learn the material in this course. You must be on time and engaged in class. You must be participating by working either independently or with a group, actively listening to a lecture and/or class discussion and completing the tasks assigned weekly."
Pink,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly. The time after the Christmas break is an opportunity to turn a corner and demonstrate stronger skills and committment than has been shown thus far."
Pink,"Khalid seemed to be engaging and understanding well in class when present. However, the completion rate of his weekly tasks on the AES platform varied, some of them being very low. He needs to improve his seminar skills, listening skills and written work. Furthermore, he needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on the AES platform are likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,You have done well in the module so far and I am happy to see that you have engaged with the asynchronous activities. Please aim to complete all assignment and asynchronous activities in the future weeks to maintain your level of performance.
Red,
Green,"You actively engage in-synchronous activities and answer questions in the class. You mentioned that you have some previous background in programming and I believe that helps you with your progress so far. To maintain your performance, please aim to complete all asynchronous activities in the module and continue to maintain with class activities."
Green,"I am happy that you engage in class activities, and you are responsive in class. Please make every effort to attend all your sessions and email your tutors if you miss a session. Please aim to complete all asynchronous activities and maintain your level of engagement in class activities."
Pink,"Khalid demonstrates satisfactory classroom performance, when present. His listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below 40% in his listening and writing assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IY1 course. Attending writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. He may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Green,"Khalid has achieved a high level of understanding in his Machine Fundamentals module, and he is performing well in his summative assessments. He actively engages with class activities and group discussions. 
To maintain and improve his level of performance, he should work on his attendance and make every effort to avoid missing classes where possible. Overall, he is doing well in the machine fundamentals."
Pink,"Khalid has to put in a lot of effort if he wants to achieve a good grade. His attendance needs improvement and that is the key to learning. Khalid has the ability to do much better. He achieved 54% in the SA1 but to achieve better marks in SA2 and SA3, he needs to work on his engagement, participation, attendance, along with making full use of additional workshops provided. He is told that I am available to any extra hep if he needs it."
Amber,"I am happy to confirm that Khalid is active in class when he attends his IY1_OOP I classes and he seems to be making good progress with his Java programming. However, he has missed one of his summative assessments which is due to unforeseen circumstances. I am sure that if he continues to work hard, he will be able to catch up with the class and make up his missed assessment in a resit opportunity. He should continue to practice with examples and exercises in the slides every week."
Pink,"Khalid seems to be making good progress with the module, however, he has missed his summative assessment submission on Friday 23rd of April. 
He is an active student in class, and he engages with class activities.He should aim to attend all of his classes and complete all exercise and examples in a weekly basis. I am sure that if he works hard, he will be able to catch up with his studies in the module and meet his progression requirements."
Pink,"Khalid tends to be absent from classes so far this term. His overall grades are far below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. He is advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. I also advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will develop his critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops is recommended. Being more participating, doing extensive listening and reading exercises, and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve the chances of his progression."
Amber,Khalid has done well in the S1 (94%). He needs to make sure that his attendance is strong in this module as the assessments are taking place every second week. His attendance in semester 2 is patchy. He has missed 4 sessions out of 8. He really needs to work on his attendance.
Amber,"I am happy to see that you have passed the module, but you have missed your submission on summative assessment 5. You will have a resit opportunity to submit your poster. Please take the opportunity to increase your score and maximise the contribution to your GPA."
Green,Well done on successfully passing the module. Keep up the good work in the next semester.
Green,"Well done, you have made a good start to the module. You need to improve your attendance in class and engage with class activities. 
Please catch up with the material on Moodle, watch the recorded videos and practice with examples and exercises from class notes. 
If you have any questions, you can attend the workshop sessions or bring them to class to discuss them at the end of every session."
Green,"Well done, You have passed and met your progression requirements. You may wish to review and practice with examples and exercises from IY1_OOP I to improve your performance in IY1_OOP II."
Pink,"I am happy to see that you have done well in your first summative assessment. However, you have missed your second summative assessment, and you have missed several sessions in the module. I am concerned with your lack of engagement in class activities. You should take your studies seriously and aim to attend all remaining sessions and complete the future summative assessments."
Green,
Amber,"Khalid seems to be making an effort to turn the page in AES, and last week participated in a seminar discussion of a good level. If he continues in the same vein, I feel that he is capable of passing AES."
Amber,"Khalid needs to work on his attendance. Due to his absences, he has missed his SA2. However, he did manage to submit SA3. Khalid needs to work on his attendance, make sure that he does not miss further sessions as the individual project and presentation work has been started which together weighs 60% of the module total. If he becomes consistent with his attendance, this will improve his performance in this module."
Green,"Khalid has demonstrated a strong performance in the module, and he is making good progress. He needs to attend all his classes and continue to engage with class activities. He should aim to complete all exercises to maintain his level of performance."
Amber,"Khalid seems to be making some progress in the module. He is active when he is present in the sessions, and he engages with the session. However, he needs to attend all remaining sessions as he has missed a lot of his classes. I am sure that if he works hard and keeps on track with his timeline for completing his final project, he will meet the progression requirements, and he will complete and pass the module."
Green,"Khalid seems to be making good progress on the module. 
Khalid needs to take his studies seriously and turn up to his classes. In my conversations with him, he seems to be a genuinely interested student in his studies, however, due to travelling over the past few weeks, he has lost some of his classes. He needs to attend all remaining sessions and engage well with class activities to succeed in his course."

Red,"Although Shing Yin has been attending all his English classes and seemingly engages with class activities, my main concern centres around the completion of required tasks outside of class. So far, he has not completed any homework tasks since the beginning of term; due to some technical issues he was not able to properly engage with his first set of mock exams; and his engagement with the online English platform is low. I have on numerous occasions tried to contact him to address these issues, but he has not to respond to emails. So without any evidence of his work or even the opportunity to engage in dialogue outside of class, I can only award Shing Yin a red at this point."
Amber,"I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Your mark for summative assessment  2 is satisfactory and shows that you have been working harder since summative 1. However, I see a huge potential in you for doing better at this course.  I would like you to be more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I think you can further improve your performance by being focused and engaged during the class. Moreover, you should not miss any of the workshops as they are currently mandatory for you."
Amber,"I believe your progress in this module is average. Good attendance record. Although, your mark for summative assessments 1 is concerning. I am concerned with your engagement in the class. I see a huge potential in you for doing better at this course. I would like you to be more active and focused during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I also recommend you to practice maths by solving multiple examples and exercises from the slides and the textbook. I believe more practice is going to help you perform better in your next assessments. I also want you to be serious about your assignments and quizzes. Moreover, you should not miss any of the workshops as they are currently mandatory for you."
Green,"I would encourage Hung to put more effort into getting more active in class. He has demonstrated good problem-solving skills however more practice with coding is needed. So, Hung has to keep practice coding to get comfortable with programming, and is strongly encouraged to confidently ask questions, share his ideas and seek help about his work."
Green,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

Green,
Pink,"Shing Yin's first set of summative exam and assessment results have been mixed with fails in his reading and writing, and unless he truly focuses on improving these skills he is at risk of not achieving progression. He did, however, perform reasonably well in his speaking/ seminar which is his stronger skill. So moving forward, Shing Yin, should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals, and act upon the feedback given to him by his AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to his performance."
Green,Shing has commendable attendance and effort level into his work. He is consistent with his studies and managed to score 93% in SA1. He needs to keep up with his studies and finish the course successfully. Shing also needs to work on his participation in group activities and class discussions.
Green,"You have made good progress, well done!! You will progress faster by spending more time studying, including going over the materials on Moodle, revising what you have learnt, working on the exercises and practise coding with Java. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."
Green,"You have made good progress, well done!!

Green,I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Active during the class and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Your marks for summative assessments 1 is also satisfactory and shows that you have been working hard. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to do more practice by solving different examples. Try to complete all exercises in our slides which will help you to do even better in your next assessment.

Pink,"Guoxin's first set of mock results do not reflect his true ability, in fact it seems as though he may have encountered some technical issues, or perhaps did not pay them enough attention. I hope that the upcoming formative exams will show an improved performance. One area that he should work on is his engagement with the online English platform on which I would like him to complete the screens as instructed each week -- by doing so will help him better understand the specifics of academic English in more detail, as this will place him in good stead for his summative assessments. Guoxin in an active participant in class and makes some good contributions, so a pleasure to have in class."
Red,"I am very concerned about your progress in this module. You are not attending the workshops although they are mandatory for you. Your engagement with Moodle is next to none and you have missed all of your assignments and quizzes. Your mark for summative assessment  2 is also concerning when compared to summative 1 and shows that you may not have been working hard enough since summative 1. You are constantly distracted during the class, and neither take participate in class discussions nor can answer any questions during the session. You must not miss any more sessions, should start working very hard and need to be serious about your assignments and quizzes. You need to review all of the missed sessions and try to catch up to speed. I would also like you to be active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions.

Red,"I am very concerned about your progress in this module. You have missed a lot of our lessons. You are not attending the workshops although they are mandatory for you. Your engagement with Moodle is none and you have missed many of your assignments and quizzes. However, your performance in summative assessment 1  was very good. You are constantly distracted during the class, and neither take participate in class discussions nor can answer any of my questions during the session. You must not miss any more sessions, should start working very hard and need to be serious about your assignments and quizzes. You need to review all of the missed sessions and try to catch up to speed. Moreover, you should not miss any of the workshops as they are currently mandatory for you. You also need to make sure that you are attending the classes from an appropriate place, not outdoor, and car."
Amber,"Guoxin is trying to improve. He should focus towards developing logical thinking about how computing process works, how he can break down a problem to solve complex ones. 
Guoxin will definitely progress faster by doing more studying out of class, including going over the materials on Moodle, finishing exercises that are set. So, my advice would be to do more practice and be more active in class and confidently ask questions, share your ideas and seek help about your work to cover topics."
Amber,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too.

Amber,"I am pleased to report that Guoxin has, overall, performed quite well in his summative exams and has achieved a reasonable grade for his CW1 assessment. I hope that Guoxin continues to maintain this level of performance as I am sure he will achieve progression. One area that he should focus on, and one that we have discussed, is his listening as this was his lowest score.  Moving forward, Guoxin, should access the listening exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals."
Amber,"Guoxin has to work on his attendance and participation in class. He has a positive attitude towards his studies but the communication skills need addressing. He understands the subject and does well. However, he needs to be consistent with his attendance and participation. Guoxin will have to work hard to successfully complete this course."

You will progress faster by spending more time studying, including going over the materials on Moodle, revising what you have learnt, working on the exercises and practise coding using Python. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly and be sure to spend time working on assignments to submit them on time."
Red,"You seem to have a positive attitude towards you studies. However, your engagement in class activities and your performance in the latest summative assessment is cause of concern. I have serious concerns regarding your progression in the course and your progress in the module. Your attendance in classes is very poor (Attendance 56%) and I rare hear from you during the group discussions. 

You should make every effort to attend all remaining sessions. You should engage in class discussions and aim to answer questions during the session. 

You should take your studies seriously and work very hard to catch up with the rest of the class and any missed sessions. You should review and practice with material from missed sessions and attend workshop sessions in coming weeks
I am expecting you to send me a weekly progress report with your study plans. Please get in touch with your lecturer in the module to arrange regular weekly meetings to monitor and support your study routines."

Pink,"Arda - joined late is keen on attending classes, needs to improve attendance and improve in submitting homework on time. Need to concentrate more on asynchronous activities."
Amber,
Red,"Arda is at risk of failing to progress unless he works extra hard on his AES course. He shows a limited understanding of the concepts introduced so far and his writing and listening skills are particularly weak. He has scored below 30% in his listening, reading and writing assessments to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. He needs to participate more in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing independent learning materials on the AES platform are likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,Arda appears to be a good student with some aptitude for the subject. When asked questions in class he is always able to offer an answer although at times the insight of this answer is not deep enough. His formative work was very good and I am very hopeful that Arda will be successful on this course if he maintains his energy and commitment.
Amber,"Arda - You show some interest in class but you need to make more of an effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussions that take place in breakout rooms. Your attendance is also patchy and needs to improve in term 2. Your score for your formative 1 assessment was also low (57%). This shows you clearly need to improve your engagement and work. To improve you need to concentrate and complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. Term 2 is an important term as things will get faster and more work will be expected. You must come back with a determination to do better."
Green,Arda has shown a steady progress regarding the subject-specific knowledge and analytical skills which vey well reflected in the grade for Formative 1. I appreciate the systematic and comprehensive approach with which he engages with various tasks. He is conscientious and hard-working. I welcome his contributions to the class discussions and I am pleased to see that his class participation has improved a lot over the last weeks.

Red,"Arda always needs reminders and encouragement to begin tasks in class. He continues to have difficulty with completing homework assignments and engaging with the AES Online platform. Arda must work on improving his academic reading and writing skills and must attend the workshops recommended to him by his tutor. The student missed the AES summative writing exam, which is a concern as he consistently scores below the required 50% in reading and writing skills. To improve his marks, Arda must complete independent study tasks on AES Online every week as well as the mock exam practice set by his tutor. He must also remember to put the dates and times of his AES assessments in his calendar."
Amber,"Arda is showing some signs for concern. His attendance is not consistently good and his participation in class is low when he does attend. His Summative 1 score was 53, but contrary to the advice given he did not submit a resit. This is going to make it harder for him to achieve the necessary marks to achieve progression. Arda needs to decide if he is serious about his studies and take steps to improve his performance - as a minimum resolve to attend every class and participate."
Amber,"Arda - You show some interest in the class, but you need to make more of an effort to communicate with your peers and participate more in group discussions in breakout rooms.  It is disappointing that despite a good start your attendance of workshops slipped a little towards the end of this term. Your summative-1 assessment score is 58%, which is not far from a score that could enable you to progress. To improve, you need to complete more independent work and complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle. Memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook and use key terms in your assignments."
Pink,Arda needs to work very hard to achieve progression. His submission for the Summative Assessment 1 was very poor and his Resit was sent to the Academic Misconduct Panel. His attendance and class engagement were low this term and no asynchronous activity was submitted. Arda has a lot to catch up with for this course. He also needs to improve his work ethic and show a real commitment towards progression.

Red,"Zirui has been attending all his English classes and engages with class activities, however my main concern centres around the completion of required tasks outside of class. He has not completed homework tasks and did not properly engage with his first set of mock exams, so I am not able to provide focussed support. I hope that the formative exams will show his true ability so that an accurate assessment of his English skills can be made. He has demonstrated some good speaking skills - so keep up the contributions."
Amber,"Zirui is a quiet student, who has a lot to offer. Zirui tends to put his ideas in the chat box instead of actually speaking, which stems from his lack of confidence in himself and in his language skills. I believe if Zirui improves his confidence levels and works on elevating his linguistic skills, he can prove to be a valuable and vocal contributor to the class discussion. Zirui managed a moderately passing grade in his formative assessment, which can improved with some attention being paid to the feedback."
Amber,"Zirui is a quiet students with a lot to say, but lacks the confidence to say it at times. Zirui performed moderately  in his formative assessment, and needs to work on his confidence as well as language skills to achieve a better grade."
Amber,"Zirui always has amazing idea and insights to share with class. However, he does so in the chat box as I think he is quite shy in speaking in front of everyone. I think if he was to become more vocal in class he would be able to contextualise all the concepts better."
Red,"Zirui is a quiet student in QM classes and does not contribute much. There is concern that Zirui may need to work exceptionally hard at passing this module. Zirui also did not submit a formative assessment as well, which elevates the above mentioned concern."
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,
Pink,"Zirui's first set of summative exam and assessment results have been very mixed with fails in reading and CW1 and only just achieving 40% in his writing. Unless he truly focuses on improving these skills, he is at risk of not achieving progression. He did, however, perform reasonably well in his speaking/ seminar and listening. For now, I have awarded Zirui a pink due to his fails, but I remain optimistic that he will achieve progression as long as he applies himself. So moving forward, Zirui should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals, and act upon the feedback given to him by his AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to his performance."
Amber,"Zirui is a quiet student, who has a lot to offer. He has improved his confidence levels and is now more contributive in class. However, Zirui still needs to work on his language skills and make sure that he understand the criterion for academic misconduct."
Amber,"Zirui needs to keep up with the work to ensure progression. He needs to ensure he fully understands the topics covered. To help him with this, he should be engaging in creating mind-maps of all the concepts and ideas being explored in class and use this as part of his revision. Practising calculations outside of class is also essential to secure higher grades and move from amber to green. I am happy to provide him with exercises and suggest he reaches out to me for tutorials where I can guide him better."
Amber,"Zirui is a quiet student with a lot to say, but lacks the confidence to say it at times. However, Zirui has improved his confidence when compared with last semester and is now more active in the MMC classes. Zirui needs to make sure that he asked for help where necessary and make use of tutor’s feedback in order to achieve good grades."
Amber,"Zirui is a quiet student in OS classes, but his contribution has increased as compared to last semester. Zirui needs to work extra hard to write his summative assessments in his own words, and correctly references all sources as well as keep note of their quality."

His listening, reading and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below 35% in his listening and reading assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IY1 course. Attending listening and writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Adam is a keen and enthusiastic student. He often researches current examples and brings significant insight into the class discussion. Adam can be a little quiet in class at times and needs to pump up his confidence, both during class and during presentations. Adam received a barely passing mark in his formative assessment, and really needs to put in the work to get a much better mark in his summative assessment."
Pink,"Adam is an active student who intermittently contributes to the class discussion. In his presentation and other written work, Adam needs to focus on avoiding reading off the slides and actually give in-depth information in his narrations. Adam received a moderately well mark in formative assessment, feedback for which was discussed in his tutorial."
Amber,"Adam is a good student who is attentive and regular in class. However, he only scored moderately in his formative assessment he needs to work on developing his self-reflection and self-evaluation skills if he wants to achieve a better grade in his summative assessments. Adam also needs to take the feedback from his formative assessment seriously and follow the tips provided."
Red,"Adam struggles in QM and that is indicated by his formative score (24%). Adam needs to pay more attention in class. He also needs to self-reflect and identify which topics he struggles with so that the tutor can help him in either the lecture, seminar, or workshop. Adam has plenty of opportunities to ask for help and he should avail those opportunities if he wants to pass this module."

He needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending reading and writing workshops is still recommended. Doing independent study using resources available to him on the AES platform is likely to improve his chances of progression."
Amber,"Adam is a keen and enthusiastic student. He often researches current examples and brings significant insight into the class discussion. However, Adam can be a little inattentive in class at times and needs to pay more attention on the concepts being discussed."
Amber,"Adam needs to be consistent with his work and attendance. My advice to him would be to work on ensuring he is also working hard outside of class to ensure he is stretched and extending his knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Adam from amber to green."
Green,"Adam is an active student who intermittently contributes to the class discussion. In his presentation in class for group exercises, Adam needs to focus on avoiding reading off the slides or off websites, and actually give in-depth information in his own words."
Amber,"Adam often struggles with some concepts of organisational studies, and this is apparent when he does not know the answer during in-class discussions or questions. Adam needs to pay more attention in seminars, as well as do revision from the lecture slides before each class to refresh the concepts."
Green,Good performance in this module. Well done. Continue to apply the quantitative and problem-solving skills acquired in semester 2.

Pink,"Shuai's first set of mock exam results have shown his performance needs some attention, particularly in his reading and writing as he did not achieve a pass mark. So he needs to focus more on these skills and carry out the practice exercises to help strengthen them. A greater engagement with the online English platform will help him better understand the specifics of academic English in more detail. I believe that Shuai is capable of much more, as long as he applies himself better and asks any questions that he may have to help him achieve his progression."
Amber,"Shuai is a bright student who needs to contribute and engage more in class. Shuai needs to build up his confidence by being more active in class and by asking questions if he is having an issue with a particular topic. Shuai scored moderately in his formative assessment but, I believe, he has the potential to achieve much higher grades in his summative."
Amber,"Shuai has the potential to achieve very good marks, but is often lagged behind due to his lack of confidence when presenting his own work. For this reason, Shuai scored only moderately in his formative assessment. Shuai needs to work on his confidence and his English skills in order to achieve higher results."
Amber,"Shuai is working hard in the module but needs to increase his engagement in class. He has, in my opinion, improved his engagement from Week 1 but still needs to work on a more opinionated input during class instead of just generic information."
Red,"Shuai often looks zoned-out or lost in class, perhaps due to there being a short attention span. Shuai needs to be more participative in class and make sure that he pays attention to what is being taught. He also did not submit a formative assessment, so he will need to either enquire for separate feedback from the tutors or work on his summative without any feedback."
Amber,
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,
Amber,"Shuai's first set of summative exam and assessment results have been a little mixed with a fail in listening and only achieving 46% in his writing. Unless he truly focuses on improving these skills, he is at risk of not achieving progression. He did, however, perform very well in his speaking/ seminar. For now, I have awarded Shuai an amber as I am optimistic that he will reach progression. So moving forward Shuai should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals, and act upon the feedback given to him by his AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to his performance."
Amber,"Shuai is a good student, but has the potential to be even better. He has overcome his initial shyness of participating in class and is more contributive than before. Shuai still needs to work on his in-class engagement as well as on improving the quality of his written work."
Green,"Shuai is working at the level expected. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Shuai has the potential to achieve very good marks, but is often lagged behind due to his lack of confidence when presenting his own work. This was discussed with Shuai last semester as well, and although he has improved, he has the potential to do even better."
Amber,"Shuai has the potential to do much better in this module. Shuai needs to be more participative in class and make sure that he pays attention to what is being taught. He has the potential to struggle with a theory-led module, such as organisational studies, perhaps due to the language barrier. However, with dedication and effort, Shuai can achieve a good grade in this module."

Pink,"Berkay has a lot of work to put in if he wants to achieve a good grade in this module. He needs to work on his engagement, participation, attendance, and the quality and relevance of his submitted work. Berkay has the ability to do much better, but he needs to also have interest and the attitude it takes to become a high achiever. Berkay has also been repeatedly told that I am available to offer him extra help and tutorials if he feels he needs them."
Pink,"Berkay contributes actively in this modules and asks insightful questions in class. Berkay got 44% in his formative assessment, due to low quality and relevance of the information presented. In his tutorial, Berkay understood the reasons behind his low marks and was given tips on how to achieve a higher mark in the summative."
Pink,"Berkay started as regular in this semester but has become quite inconsistent  overall. He barely passed the formative assessment in MF, after which I think he should have worked harder at attending and listening in class."
Red,"Berkay is consistently struggling with this module and is often inconsistent with attendance. He has been told to attend an extra workshop on Fridays to help him with this module, and he not regular in those either. Berkay did not submit his formative assessment, so there is no parameter or platform for him receive feedback on. Berkay has been told, in-class and via emails, that he needs to start putting in more effort into the module otherwise it is highly unlikely that he will pass."

Green,"Berkay has done well and is a great character to have in the class. I feel he is capable of even better scores in the second exams, and I would also like him to focus on cutting out the mistakes he occasionally makes in his writing when he rushes his composition."
Amber,Berkay has improved his attendance and participation since last semester. He has become more engaging in class discussions. Berkay can further improve his performance by improving the quality of his work and the sources he used in the assessments.
Green,"Berkay is a hard-working student. He completes the work set and is not afraid to ask for help. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Berkay contributes actively in this module and asks insightful questions in class. Berkay needs to work on articulating his knowledge better during presentations, instead of reading out information. Berkay has the potential to score high in this module if he can work on his language skills."
Green,Berkay has shown much promise in this module as he contributes well in seminar discussions and does due research for any activities given. Berkay needs to work on his writing skills and make sure that he can accurately articulate how clear his concepts are in his summative assessments.
Green,Good performance in this module. You struggled with summative 1 but worked hard and showed a great improvement in summative 2. Well done and continue to apply the quantitative and problem-solving skills acquired in semester 2 and beyond.

He had two opportunities to complete the seminar assessment this week. On the first occasion his camera wasn't working, and on the second occasion he didn't turn up at all."
Pink,"Your engagement during synchronous activities has not been the best because you usually do not participate until it is time for the register. Additionally, you did not submit any formative assessment for International Business."
Pink,"Cem is an unusual student. His attendance has been a little patchy and he is often late for class, but when he does focus his attention on the subject he does seem to have some understanding. However, this is not enough for him to succeed on the course overall. He did not submit a formative assignment and this is very concerning. Unless Cem is able to seriously commit to his studies I am very concerned that he will not succeed this year."
Pink,"Though you log on to Zoom, you do not engage with the class because you are usually not available when you are required to answer questions, only to resurface when it is time for the register. Additionally, there was no Management First Formative submission from you."
Pink,You have put in little to no effort towards improving your Quantitative Methods skills which is evident in your non-submission of the formative assessment.

Red,"Cem has consistently displayed a lack of the engagement and commitment necessary to pass an AES course. Both in course work assignments and exams he has either not attended or made any attempt to follow normal procedures, making it impossible to provide him with the support he needs.
Both myself and Christopher Storrs-Fox have tried our utmost to provide Cem with the opportunity to succeed in AES, but unfortunately these efforts appear to have been in vain."
Amber,Your attendance and class engagement have been good but you need to improve on your moodle engagement beacause you need to utilise the resources provided to prepare for your assessments.
Red,"Cem attends lectures and seminar. However, he doesn't get involved and does not complete the work. At this rate I am very concerned that Cem will not succeed and this would be a shame as he has the potential to do well, but is letting himself down by being very disengaged. It is vital that as we come closer to the first summative in this module, Cem is mindful of how he is organising his time to ensure he has plenty of opportunity to ask for help and not be late in submitting his work."
Green,"Your performance in this module has been satisfactory. You submitted and passed the resits for both summative 1 & 2. In semester 2, apply the feedback and skills you have received for an improvement in your performance."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, there is more room for improvement so work towards higher grades in the second semester through class and moodle engagement."
Pink,"Cem gives me a great deal of concern as he rarely attends class and when he does his engagement is poor. This included arriving at class whilst taking a walk in the countryside! Cem does not lack the required intellectual capability to succeed on this course, but his approach lets him down and hampers his possible success."
Amber,"At the beginning of this semester, your class engagement was not the best. Though there has been some improvement in this respect, you are encouraged to attempt to answer more questions during the seminars and also improve on your moodle engagement to utilise the learning materials provided."
Green,"Although you struggled a bit with this module, your hard work helped you to pass both summative 1 and 2. Continue to improve on your quantitative and problem-solving skills."

Pink,"Bobby worked hard and always completed his AES tasks with high percentages. However, given the high entry requirements from RHUL for arts, he needs to improve his seminar skills, listening skills and written work. Furthermore, he needs to participate more in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on the AES platform are likely to improve chances of progression."
Pink,"You made a farily solid start in the Literature module but recently seem to have lost some ground and seem somewhat confused. Your assignment, which was submitted late, was reflective of that, as it demonstrated that you did not fully understand the question - and we will talk about this in greater depth at your tutorial. You need to work hard to ensure you don't lose any further ground: you must continue to participate in group work and class work, something which we have already spoken about. While you have the ability to be successful in this module, it is not guaranteed and will require a lot of work from you over the coming months."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  Your formative assessment did not quite meet all the criteria, but hopefully you have learned from that feedback and will apply it to your first summative assessment. You did have excellent attendance this semester, which means that you are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Pink,"I am concerned with Bobby's ability to progress. He was late to join in, and he struggled with IT. I have held tutorials with him with Simone, and have brought him in contact with Chris for Kortext access. Despite these efforts, he failed to submit a Formative 1, while his engagement with asynchronous activities overall on Moodle is problematic (the excuse of not being familiar with IT is not valid now)."

Red,
Pink,"Haoyu tends to be focused on the content in class and shows a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. However, his overall grades are below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. He is advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. Attending writing workshops is still recommended. Attending listening workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of his progression."
Red,You have clearly found Literature very difficult this term and have had some problems with the assignments. You did not submit a Formative 2 or a Summative 1 Resit which is why you have a 'red' here. It has been quite difficult to engage you in discussions to help you improve. If you want to help yourself you need to do a lot of hard work and remember that we are here to help you. We will discuss all of this in your tutorial.
Pink,"This term has been quite difficult for you. While you do engage at times in class and make interesting contributions, when it comes to assessments you really seem to struggle. You need to be more organised in terms of taking notes and revising the material every week. I highly recommend you make full use of the break to plan and prepare for your S2 portfolio, and feel free to reach out to me if you need any help."
Red,"This term has been quite difficult for you. It started badly when you completely missed the deadline for the summative, and then submitted the wrong assignment for the resit. This reflects a consistent problem with you, which is time management and organisation. You do make really good contributions in class, which is good to see. But the other part is that you also need to take notes, revise the lecture material, and engage with homework and asynchronous activities every single week. Unfortunately, you have not been doing this. For this reason your knowledge and understanding are quite lacking. I strongly recommend you use the Easter break to thoroughly revise all the concepts and terms from Sociology, and please reach out to me if you need any extra advice or help with how to do this."
Red,"Haoyu demonstrates good learning attitudes and he is fully focused on the content. However, he shows a limited understanding of the concepts introduced so far as his speaking and listening skills are particularly weak. In speaking activities he often could not produce grammatically correct English. He has scored well below 40% in all of his assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. He missed the deadlines on CW1 submission, reading exam as well as the meetings with the HoE and me on his study plan. He should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. Speaking more English, doing extensive listening, reading and writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. It is also imperative that he attends all the AES workshops on a regular basis."

It is obvious that he puts a good level of effort into his work. If he can sustain or improve this, it will be a factor in his success. He is making good progress and should aim to maintain or even improve on this going forward. His performance in exams is satisfactory but should improve his listening and reading skills."
Green,"Albert is clearly an intelligent student who has good understanding of the topics in class. He contributes to class discussion and has the confidence to ask questions if he does not understand something. He is also very capable of answering questions when asked. I also note that the depth of insight he offers when answering questions is better than most students and this bodes well for his future studies. His formative result was good and I hope this will get better. If I was to give Albert some advice I would say that he should take his studies seriously and apply himself - it is possible that he will neglect hard work if he feels that he can get through on a lower level of work, but this will miss the opportunity to excel."
Amber,"58% in F1 - well done! A big improvement on diagnostic test result. He needs to keep working on focusing more. Albert attended one workshop, where he identified he'd like support in a variety of topics but has not attended any since. He should attend several more workshops to get more support in the future. Also, he needs to take his time to check his work (especially for assessments). But overall, doing much better in terms of quality of work and engagement recently, well done! Review partial factors and factor theorem."
Green,"Albert - You are a pleasure to teach. You show strong interest in classwork and participate in all group discussions. I was also very pleased with your formative 1 assessment score (73%). Your performance is excellent and you need to now maintain this in order to meet your progression requirements. Please continue to complete all asynchronous actives on Moodle, engage with your Kortext textbook and dedicate some time to independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook."

He is also a conscientious student. During the holiday can revise the features of academic writing and start working on his CW3. He can refer to the materials on Insendi"
Green,"Albert is a student that obviously has a lot of potential. His summative 1 mark was 74 and this reflects well on his capabilities. However, Albert needs to think about how he applies himself to his studies as they become more challenging going forward. His attendance is inconsistent and so is his involvement in class activities. Albert now needs to improve his energy and motivation a little and take his studies more seriously so that he can achieve his full potential."
Red,"58% in F1, 35% in F2, 40% in S1. This student has struggled with attendance and connection issues and time management throughout. However, he understand maths quite well as shown in F1 and when he engages in class. Therefore, Albert should work hard to improve his attendance as well as engagement and attempt to revise term 2 material through Easter."
Amber,"Albert – You show some interest in class and participate in activities and discussions held in breakout rooms. However, your summative 1 score of 61% is a little low and could be improved. To do this you need to concentrate and complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle. Memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook and use these key terms more frequently in your assignments."

You have also been consistent in your completion of the AES platform activities. Well done! Unfortunately you did not complete any exams in the middle of term, so I do not have a clear idea of your strengths and weaknesses in AES. I look forward to seeing your week 10 exam results."
Amber,"Ali is a good student who shows a great deal of interest in the subject. He is generally engaged in class and shows good focus on his studies. 

His formative result was a little disappointing, but I believe that he has the capability to consider the feedback and develop his approach going forward. If he is able to do this then Ali will be very successful on this course."
Green,"64% in F1, good job. Overall, he is very engaged in class. Keep reviewing your class notes. Has been attending workshops and has benefited from that. Remember to always check your notes carefully. Review solving inequalities, partial fractions and  factor theorem."

You have strong potential to progress, and this is most clearly evidenced by your recent formative assessment score (68%).

These steps will ensure your success."

Amber,"Ali shares his ideas during group presentations and is a co-operative and respectful student. However, his academic reading and writing skills need further development in order to meet the RHUL requirements of 50% for reading and writing. Therefore, Ali must do independent study using resources available on the AES Online platform, complete mock exams and submit the compulsory AES tasks every week. Continuous efforts put into the improvement of his academic skills in term 3 should increase Ali’s chances of progression to the UG course at RHUL."
Green,Ali is a serious and committed student. He is very focussed in class and often contributes to class discussion. He also has the confidence to ask questions if he needs support. His summative 1 result was good and I am very confident about his future success as long as he maintains his high levels of energy and motivation.
Amber,"61% in F2, 9% in S1, 64% in F1. This student was ill when he was writing S1, resulting in a fail. This is unfortunate, as on the whole this student asks questions, make a lot of effort to answer the tutors' question in class, engages with asynchronous work and is genuinely interested in the subject. F2 mark reflects his hard word and enthusiasm, so I hope that for S2, Ali will continue working as hard and ensuring he reviews his notes carefully."
Green,"Mostafawi - You are a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest in class and get involved in group discussions, demonstrating a sound command of the subject. You have strong potential to progress, and this is most clearly evidenced by your recent summative assessment score (70%).  To go even further, ensure you complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your success."

Green,"Zain has attended most of the classes. In the live sessions, he shares her ideas which he usually expresses in group discussions. However, he should try to attend all lessons and participate more.  It is obvious that he puts considerable effort into his studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. In addition, he can apply his knowledge under assessment conditions and in practical tasks quite well. He needs to practise his note-taking skills for the listening component of the exam,"
Green,Good engagement with both synchronous and asynchronous activities. Incorporate the feedback received for your formative assessment to improve on subsequent assessments.
Amber,"Zain is a good student who shows good understanding in class. However, he does not participate in class as much as he could and this would help him develop his knowledge and understanding going forward. His formative 1 result was good, but this should not encourage him to relax his efforts. He should continue to work on his studies, attend classes and participate fully in class to ensure success going forward."
Amber,"Though there has been some improvement, you still need to work on your attendance and your class engagement. Additionally, take note of the feedback received for your formative assessment."
Amber,There has been some improvement in your Quantitative Methods skills but you need to work a little harder. Submission of the formative assessment would have greatly helped but you failed to do that.

In addition, he can apply her knowledge under assessment conditions and in practical tasks quite well.  Hia exam results are very good except listening."
Amber,Your attendance and class engagement have been good but you need to improve on your moodle engagement because the materials you need to prepare for your assessments have been provided in moodle.
Red,"Zain attends a few sessions but does not really complete the work expected from him. At this rate I am very concerned that Zain will not succeed and this would be a shame as he has the potential to do well, but is letting himself down by being very disengaged. It is vital that as we come closer to the first summative in this module, Zain is mindful of how he is organising his time to ensure he has plenty of opportunity to ask for help and not be late in submitting his work."
Amber,You did not submit any assessments for this module and you failed to submit any resits. Follow the progression outline you have been provided with.
Pink,
Green,"Satisfactory performance in this module. However, there is more room for improvement so work towards higher grades in the second semester."
Pink,Zain shows a lack of focus in his studies and does not participate in class discussions. He often turns his camera off in classes and does not engage in the class. I am concerned about Zain's overall progress and he now needs to alter his approach to his studies if he is to succeed this year.
Amber,"To excel in this module, you need to improve on your attendance and moodle engagement which have not been the best so far. This is because during synchronous activities, you have the opportunity of having topics explained and learning materials for this module are available on moodle to help you with your preparation for your assessments."
Green,Good performance in this module. You have submitted and passed the resits for both summative 1 and 2.
Pink,"Zain tends to be focused on the content in class, when present. However, his overall grades are below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. He is advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. Attending writing workshops is recommended. Being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises, and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve the chances of his progression."
Green,"Zain has joined my classes this semester. He is concerned about doing well in his studies. He participates in class discussion and attends his classes regularly. 

No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,"Zain does the work but just needs to be consistent with it. My advice to him would be to work on ensuring he is also working hard outside of class to ensure he is stretched and extending his knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Zain from amber to green."
Pink,Zain continues to show a lack of focus on his studies. He has only attended 52% of classes so far this term and when he is in class he is very quiet. If Zain is to be successful this year he needs to change his approach to his studies by attending class and when he is in class becoming involved in the activities.
Pink,"Zain, your attendance, moodle and class engagement have not been the best and you need to improve. Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."

Green,Arslan is a very capable student who I would expect to achieve very good results in AES.
Amber,"You did not submit any formative assessment for International Business, a situation that you attributed to the fact that you missed some lectures and seminars. You therefore need to improve on your attendance and ensure that forthcoming summative assessments are submitted."
Pink,Arslan shows some cause for concern. His attendance is a little patchy and when he comes to class he does not participate in class or demonstrate attention. He is unable to answer questions when asked. He did not submit a formative assessment and this is also cause for concern. Arslan needs to seriously consider his commitment to the course and re-energise himself if he is to succeed.
Amber,You are not very punctual for the Management First Lecture on Fridays. Therefore you need to change this and pay attention to the feedback you received for your formative assessment to improve on your subsequent assessment submissions.
Amber,There has been some progress but is still more room for improvement in your Quantitative Methods skills.

Red,"Sadly, Arslan does not seem to be taking this course seriously. He has shown that he is capable of progression, but appears to think his high speaking fluency will be enough to secure his progression without putting the required time or effort into every other aspect of the course.
I do, however, know from experience that it is still possible to turn this around with the required focus and commitment."
Green,"Unlike last semester, your attendance, class and moodle engagement have been good so far. I will advise that you make maximum use of the resources available in moodle to prepare for your assessments."
Amber,"Arslan is working at a good level but, he needs to ensure he fully understands the topics covered. To help him with this, he should be engaging in creating mind-maps of all the concepts and ideas being explored in class and use this as part of his revision. Practising calculations outside of class is also essential to secure higher grades and move from amber to green. I am happy to provide Arslan with exercises and suggest he reaches out to me for tutorials where I can guide him better."
Amber,"You did not pass the resit for summative 1. However, you passed summative 2. Follow the progression course which has been outlined for you."
Green,"Although you did not submit MF1, you have submitted and passed the resit with a commendable grade of 70%. In the next semester, it will be good to see such good performance in your modules."
Pink,Arslan does not seem to take his studies seriously. He often misses classes and does not participate in class when he does attend. He often turns his camera off and it is therefore difficult to gauge his level of attention. If Arslan is to make progress this year he needs to reconsider his level of energy and apply himself to his studies with increased vigour.
Amber,"There has been a great improvement in your attendance and class engagement this semester. However, you need to improve on your moodle engagement because that is where the learning materials for this module can be found."
Green,Your performance in this module has been good. You did the resit for summative 1 and had a good score. Maintain this improved performance in your semester 2 modules.

An area that she should focus on and practise is her academic writing -- look at the feedback and model answers that have been provided in class to help understand the requirements for academic writing. Natirada is a pleasure to have in class as she is an active participant and contributes well to class discussion/ activities."
Green,There was great improvement in your engagement during seminars between RPAG1 and RPAG2.
Amber,"Natirada is a good student who pays attention in lectures. Whilst she can be a little quiet, when challenged she makes contributions to class exercises and shows some good understanding. Her formative assignment was good, but shows some opportunity for improvement. I hope that Natirada has considered the feedback she has received. I am optimistic about Natirada's future on the course as long as she maintains energy and commitment."

Amber,"I am hopeful and optimistic that Natirada will achieve progression in AES. Although Natirada's overall performance in her first set of summative exams show that her reading and writing are areas that need to be further strengthened, she achieved a good score in her listening and speaking. Moving forward Natirada should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help her prepare for her finals and take on the feedback given by her AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to her performance."
Amber,Your attendance and class engagement have been good but you need to improve on your moodle engagement because that is where you will find the resources you need to help you to prepare for your assessments.
Green,"Natirada completes the work that is expected and is on track. Now, my advice would be for her to stretch herself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, you need to carefully consider the feedback from your summatives to improve on your writing, analytical and evaluation skills for the modules in semester 2."
Green,"Good performance in this module. You submitted and passed the resit for summative 1. However, there is more room for improvement so work towards higher grades in the second semester by improving on your analytical and evaluation skills."
Amber,"Natirada is a quiet student who does not often participate in class discussions. She also finds it difficult to answer questions when asked. In order to succeed Natirada must organise herself well, maintain her focus and follow up on all of her study tasks. In particular, making notes in class and doing follow up reading would help Natirada to succeed going forward."
Green,"Good attendance, moodle and class engagement in this module so far. Your attendance and contribution in class has been particularly commendable. Keep up with this and make good use of the materials available on moodle to help with your preparation for your assessments."
Green,Good performance in this module. You improved tremendously from the beginning of the module when you had a phobia for quantitative methods. The quantitative and problem-solving skills acquired will be beneficial in semester 2 and beyond.

It is obvious that he puts a good level of effort into his work. If he can sustain or improve this, it will be a factor in his success. He is making good progress and should aim to maintain or even improve on this going forward. His performance in the reading exam was good but he also needs to practise his academic writing and listening skills."
Green,Attendance and engagement for both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be good.
Amber,Aleksander is a quiet student who appears to be making progress on the course. His energy levels in class are not high and it would be good to see this improve next term. Examples of raising his energy would be becoming more involved in class exercises and more actively answering questions rather than waiting to be asked directly. His formative result was good and I hope that this shows that he has developed some good understanding of the material so far.

H can refer to Insendi for extra materials or he can arrange tutorials with his tutor."
Amber,Your attendance and class engagement have been good with very valuable contributions in class but you need to improve on your moodle engagement because the resources you need to prepare for your assessments have been made available.

Green,"Ada is an excellent student. She is focussed during classes, takes notes and makes very positive contributions to class discussions. I would like her to contribute even more to class discussions to develop herself further.

Her formative result was excellent and this was clearly as a result of her hard work and her ability to learn. I am very confident about Ada's future academic success."
Green,"You are a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest in the class (engaging positively in group discussions) and demonstrate a sound command of the subject. You have strong potential to progress, and this is most clearly evidenced by your recent formative assessment score (66%).  Your performance is good but could be stronger and I feel you need to now stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. Improve this by completing all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your success."
Green,"70% in F1. Very diligent and active student. I am very impressed with your dedication, and motivation. It's great that you always answer correctly in lessons, and the quality of your essay is great too! In the future, please focus on adding references to statements in essays when necessary."

Amber,"Ada is obviously a very capable student however her summative 1 result was a little low compared to what I would expect from someone with her talent. Her attendance has been a little patchy in term 2 and this possibly is a symptom of a reduction in motivation or energy. 

Ada needs to reflect on her progress and to re-commit to achieving her goals in order to secure her place on her degree next year."
Green,"Ada - You are a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest in the class (engaging positively in group discussions) and demonstrate a sound command of the subject.

Green,"Good attendance, moodle and class engagement in this module so far. Your contribution in class has been particularly commendable. Keep up with this and make good use of the materials available on moodle to help with your preparation for your assessments."
Green,You demonstrated a high level of quantitative and problem-solving skills. Excellent performance in this module. Well done.

Green,"Parker`s attendance is excellent. In the live sessions, he consistently participates actively in class and makes a valuable contribution to class discussions.  It is obvious that he puts considerable effort into his studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. Parker is making good progress and should aim to maintain or even improve on this going forward. His listening exam result is lower than the other components of the exam. He needs to practise the question types."
Amber,"The 42% Parker achieved in the formative 1 assessment does not do him justice.  However, if Parker does not commit to answering questions as instructed, he will not demonstrate his full understanding of the need to show processes and not just answers.  Parker can do much better but needs to take the course a little more seriously."
Green,"A very knowledgeable and engaging students with a very good background in Physics already. He had few issues on getting his laptop repaired, during the pandemic period, so he missed two important lessons. However, he managed to catch up on the topics during the revision week. He would benefit from engaging more on the classroom calculations while the lesson is taking place. His attainment levels are good in my assessments. He will pass the module with very good marks. Parker will make a very good engineering in the future. I wish him well."
Green,"You are a fast learner, bring a positive attitude to class discussions, have been a well engaged student and an active participant in lectures."
Amber,

Amber,"Parker`s attendance is not very good, unfortunately. He has missed many lessons and is advised to attend them all  in the coming weeks He usually has some good ideas, which he expresses during class discussions on occasion. However, he should try to participate more. Although he is able to apply his knowledge under assessment conditions/in practical tasks to a reasonable degree, he missed one of his summative exams."
Red,"Parker has not engaged fully with the course and has not made use of the revision materials to support his submission for summative 1.  Unless there is a dramatic change in attitude and effort in term 3, it is unlikely Parker will achieve a pass in this unit.  

Parker needs to attend every maths workshop that fits with his timetable and be prepared to write full answers to problems being solved.  He is vocally more able than he demonstrates on paper."
Pink,"Your attendance is not good, but you have started improving it which is very good. You sometimes participate in class discussions and solve the questions. I expect you to be more active in the class, solve the questions and discuss your answers. Your S1-Resit is 26% which is very low and you also missed your F2 which was an opportunity for both you and me as your tutor to see your progress during the spring term. You need to try very hard for your S2. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle."
Amber,"Your attendance for pure maths is not good, but you have started improving it which is very good. You sometimes participate in class discussions and solve the questions. I expect you to be more active in the class, solve the questions and discuss your answers. Your S1-Resit is 60% which shows you need to work harder for your S2 and you also missed your F2 which was an opportunity for both you and me as your tutor to see your progress during the spring term. You need to try very hard for your S2. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for S2. Also, you need to attend maths workshops to be ready for the S2."

Red,"I hardly met you. From the start of the year, you have attained my class only twice. Second class you have attended you were late. Missing classes will hinder your progression. It is also disappointing you are not attending classes and not engaged in moodle. This shows you need to work hard and improve your engagement. To improve you need to attend classes regularly, concentrate and complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook."
Red,
Pink,"Muhammad's first set of mock exam results have not gone well and have shown his performance needing immediate attention, as he did not achieve a pass mark of 40% for reading and listening. I feel that his performance has been affected by his absence due to health related issues and as a result he has not truly been able to focus on his English studies in term 1. He should take full advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help him prepare and seek further support from his AES tutor."
Red,Muhammad has some significant challenges to overcome if he is going to succeed this year. His attendance has been poor and when he is in class he appears to be unprepared and lacks engagement. When he does attempt to answer questions he shows that he has some lack of understanding. While he has been asked to view recorded lectures to catch up with some previously missed classes the system log shows that he has not done so. Unless Muhammad makes a transformational change to his approach he is very unlikely to succeed this year.
Red,"Although you are showing some interest in class, you need to make a lot of effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussions in breakout rooms. Your attendance is patchy have reported encountering technical difficulties on many occasions. Try to resolve your technical issues online before term 2. It is also disappointing that you did not submit your formative-1 assessment on time. You need to engage in moodle and work hard. To improve need to concentrate and complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle. Memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. Term 2 is an important term as things will get faster and more work will be expected."
Red,"Muhammad needs to work very hard to achieve progression and to allocate a significant amount of time to catch up with the missed content this term. Whilst his submission for the Formative 1 was generally very poor, he also missed a lot of classes and didn't submit any homework or asynchronous activity this term. I recommend that he allocates more time on weekly basis to this module to complete the homework and asynchronous activities, as well as the readings."
Red,Muhammad has failed to engage and participate in his English studies. To date he has not submitted coursework and has not taken any exams. His attendance has been sporadic and when he does attend he fails to engage.
Red,"Muhammad has not acted on the feedback that he has repeatedly been given that he needs to increase his focus on his studies. His attendance remains poor and he has also failed to attend meetings that he has been invited to. His summative 1 result showed a little promise albeit below the standard required for progression. He has not submitted an assignment for formative 2 and this reduces his chances of success on that assignment. Overall, I am now not sure how, at this late stage, Muhammad can reverse the poor progress that he has made all year."
Red,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance. However, I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to succeed."
Pink,"Even though Muhammad's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 showed good progress in terms of knowledge, research and analytical skills, the total lack of engagement with this course remains worrying. To this date, Muhammad has not completed any homework, class and asynchronous activity. Moreover, in spite of his promises he has never submitted the Formative 2. I am afraid the chances of achieving a good grade in the Summative Assessment 2 are very slim."

It is essential moving forward that he improves his attendance, in order not to miss essential input for both the coursework and speaking assessments."
Amber,William is an average student. He achieved a fair mark for the IB summative 1. He can aim to work harder and to put some more effort to improve his performance.
Green,"William is a good student, quiet in seminars but when asked a question, he answers very well. He also completes his work to a high standard."
Green,"William is a good student, quiet in seminars but when asked a question, he answers very well. He also completes his work to a high standard."
Pink,"William has gained just a basic pass in his QM summative 1 assessment.
He needs to be more committed and serious with his studies to improve his performance."
Amber,"When William attends his AES classes, he always demonstrates that he is a talented AES student. The issue is that this attendance is sporadic. It would be a pity for him to jeopardise his progression with attendance issues, when his exam results were so good and he is clearly capable of achieving progression."
Green,"William is doing quite well in his studies, and he is participating more in classes. He has very good attendance in general.  No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Green,"William is a very good student. Always gets involved in seminars and workshop, he completes his work to a high standard. Now, my advice would be for William to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Amber,William is often very quiet in class. In order to develop their understanding students need to attempt to answer and ask questions in class. This is known to improve student understanding and therefore their overall success on the course. I would also suggest that William keeps his camera on for the entire duration of the class.
Amber,"William, your attendance and moodle engagement have been good, but you need to improve on your class engagement as this will help you to sharpen your English language skills and improve your confidence. 
 Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Amber,
Green,"William is keeping up quite well with his studies. He has gained a good mark for FDE S1.
He is working hard, and I expect that he will carry forward his aims to do well."
Green,
Green,"William did the IB S2 resit to improve his mark and he scored a very good mark in the S2 resit. This shows that he is working hard, and he is looking towards improving his performance."

Amber,"You need to start participating more actively in in-class activities. Try and make sure that your camera is on and that you are working with your classmates in whole class and breakout room activities. Speak with me if you need more support when it comes to in-class participation. Generally, you are making a good effort with the online materials on AES Online, but you could be a little more engaged and push yourself harder by doing some of the additional tasks as well as the required ones. Remember, the more you practice the faster you are going to improve. Your mock results were fair, though keep working at writing as this is an area that you are struggling with and need to do well in. Review the writing content covered on AES Online in Term 1 to better structure and organize your writing and make sure that you are using varied and accurate language. It would be a good idea for you to attend the AES Writing workshops on Mondays to get some extra feedback and practice."
Amber,"Your attendance for applied maths is good and you are improving your attendance by turning up in almost all the sessions. You sometimes participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by your tutor which in my opinion is not enough, I expect you to be more active in the class, participate in the discussion, and discuss about your answers. Your F1 is 45% which needs to be improved for F2 and S1. We need to have a discussion about how we can improve your grade for your F2 and S1 after the holidays. I also recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the Formative 2 and summative 1."
Pink,"Your attendance for physics is good. You missed some sessions at the beginning of the term but you now attend almost all the sessions. Your participation in the in the class discussions and solving the questions given by the tutor is not hight enough and I expect you to do more in the classroom, also it appears that you do not ask many questions in the class and based on your F1 grade which was 20% suggests that you just pass the parts of the topic that you are not sure about or not 100% clear about. This shows we need to take several serious actions to improve it for the summative 1. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the summative 1. We will have a discussion after the holidays about some possible ways to improve your physics and ability to solve questions possibly including having some extra sessions."
Amber,"Bright has the potential to achieve good results. He participates and contributes to the class activities. However, he missed the first 3 weeks of classes and right after had some issues with his attendance. Although for the past few weeks he has been attending the classes regularly. He needs to maintain his attendance and revise the content which he missed initially. He has been told that I am available for extra support and he should make use of the workshops as well. He needs to prepare well for the upcoming summative assessment 1."
Amber,"You achieved a score of 61% in the Summative Writing Exam and you have made some progress in terms of your research skills, as demonstrated in CW1 where you were awarded a mark of 54%. However, your reading skills need further development as you scored way below 40% in AES Summative Reading Exam. Bright, you should continue to work on improving your academic writing skills throughout Term 3 with the use of Mock Exams as well as independent study tasks available on the AES Online platform every week. If you continue to work on your academic skills development in Term 3, you should increase your chances of progression to your chosen UG course at Royal Holloway University of London."
Green,"Your attendance for your applied maths classes is good, and you have missed only a few sessions. Your summative 1 grade is 77% which makes you able to progress to the university this September if you only obtain about 60% of your summative 2. Therefore, I recommend you to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation and attend your applied maths classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Green,"Your attendance for your physics classes is good, and you have missed a few sessions. You made a significant improvement in your summative 1 resit (your provisional grade is 93%). Now it is time to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation and attend your physics classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Amber,"Bright has made improvements. He is consistent with his homework and class activities. However, he still needs to work harder to improve his overall score in this module. He recently scored 83% formative 2. If he takes advantage of workshops and extra tutorials, it will help in improving preparation for the upcoming summative 2."

Pink,"Deepak seems to be much more engaged than he was at the beginning of the course, but his writing and reading scores in the mock exams were a concern.
It is essential that he attends all classes in the coming weeks as we focus on exam revision and begin to work on the CW1."
Green,Deepak has demonstrated an excellent level of performance in his Machine Fundamentals module. He is active in class and he follows instructions in tasks assigned to him. He has maintained a good level of attendance (96%) in Machine Fundamentals and I hope he will start to replicate the same pattern in his other modules.
Amber,"Deepak has very good attendance and has a positive attitude towards his studies. However, he managed to score only 52% in SA1. He has the potential to do much better. He needs to make sure that he is making notes of the important concepts, practicing exercise questions, and making full use of workshops. He is also told that I am available for additional tutorials or help. Deepak will need to prepare and put in a lot of effort for SA2 and SA3."
Pink,"Deepak seems to make some progress with the module, however, he has some space for improvement with his programming skills. 
I am happy to hear questions from him during and after the end of each session. He seems to be aware of his weakness and strong points in programming. He is actively looking to improve his programming skills. 
He has an attendance level of 72% in the module at the moment which is a cause of concern. She should aim to attend all remaining sessions. 
In order to improve his programming skills, he has to take his programming module seriously and practice with the examples and exercises in the notes. He should aim to solve the problems on his own and only check the provided solutions as a tool to evaluate his answers. He can also check the sample solutions in the notes if he is stock in solving a problem for more than 10 minutes. Within the first 10 minutes of solving the problem, he should focus on her abilities to code and identifying potential errors in the code."
Amber,"Deepak seems to be making good progress with the module. He has missed few of his classes in the recent weeks and this had an impact on his performance on his third summative assessment. He should take his studies very serious and aim to attend all remaining sessions, review the examples and exercises after each session and practice with programming without checking solutions from notes. He can evaluate his work once he is confident that he has answered all parts of a question. 
He should reflect on his study plans to assure he is allocating enough hours for practice with programming and assessment preparation."
Green,"Deepak achieved fairly good results in his recent exams and appears to be on the right track in terms of engagement and motivation. My only slight concern is with his writing, where I feel improvements need to be made. We will be doing plenty of writing practice in class in the coming weeks."
Amber,"Deepak has done well in S1 (100%). However, he needs to work on his punctuality as he has been late to the session a few times. If he takes a proactive approach, he will do good in this module. Also, he needs to take on the class activities and complete them in time, his participation and attention are patchy during the session."
Green,Well done. You have passed the module and met your progression requirements.
Green,Well done on successfully passing the module. Keep up the good work in the next semester.
Green,"Well done, you have made a good start to the module. 
Please continue to practice with examples and exercises from IY1_OOP I and improve your Java programming skills. 
If you have any questions, you can attend the workshop sessions or bring them to class to discuss them at the end of every session."
Green,"Well done, You have passed and met your progression requirements. You may wish to review and practice with examples and exercises from IY1_OOP I to improve your performance in IY1_OOP II."
Green,"You have made a massive improvement on your module performance since your first summative assessment and this is demonstrated in the outcome of the second summative assessment. You have improved your level of attendance and I am happy to confirm that you are actively engaging with class activities. 
Please keep up the hard work and continue to practice with exercises and examples from notes."

He should take full advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help him prepare and seek further support from his AES tutor."
Amber,"You have shown yourself to be a keen student who thinks creatively about the subject-matter at hand. This was displayed particularly in your formative assignment, which was good and provides a firm foundation for your summative work next term. Your contributions in class are sometimes somewhat off-topic - you could work on making them rather more focused so that they relate to the matter at hand. However, it is good to see you make the effort to contribute - keep it up. Overall you have plenty to work from, so well done."
Amber,"You had a difficult first half to the term, especially because of health problems, and I now hope all that is behind you. You have made a good effort to come back since then, and you have many positives as well as things to work on. Firstly, you are excellent whenever it comes to discussing the meanings and moods of individual clips or films, and always make very insightful contributions in such activities. You have also been engaging in group discussion and classwork better and better. However, you still need to work on a few things. You especially need to be careful about managing your time when it comes to the summative, and make sure you fully understand the question, as this was a weakness in the formative. Also, you must try to stay fully focused in class, and not switch off when we discuss concepts and theory. If you do so, adding to your creativity and imagination, you can do very well."
Red,"Yiming makes many positive contributions to class discussions which are appreciated. 

Unfortunately, Yiming has suffered from health concerns which means that he has been unable to keep up with the work requirements on Moodle and has not been able to submit his formative assignment. It's therefore difficult to assess just how thoroughly Yiming has engaged with the concepts and theories in the module.

I hope that Yiming's health continues to improve and that he will be able to keep up to date with Moodle and the homework requirements."
Pink,"Yiming's first set of summative results have not shown much improvement since the mock exams, and has not achieved a pass mark of 40% for reading, writing and listening. These results also show that more time should be dedicated to his English studies if he is to achieve progression To help him prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help him pass the exams. In addition, he should also focus on his CW2 and 3 and seek the necessary support to reach his end goal."
Pink,"Your Summative 1 was good, showing that if you continue to work hard in this module you have the ability to progress. However, you did not submit a Formative 2 at all, which brings into question how hard you are working in the module. This is particularly the case as your engagement in class is somewhat patchy. Sometimes you participate both meaningfully and consistently, but sometimes you do not participate at all. You need to work harder and more evenly if you are to reach progression in this subject."
Amber,"While your creativity and intelligence have often been on display during this module, there remains a question mark over your overall engagement and dedication to doing the best you can in your studies. There have been times when you did not or would not contribute in class, which was disappointing to see. Worryingly, you have completely neglected the asynchronous activities altogether this term.

This means that I have concerns about what level your understanding of the module has reached. What I recommend now is that you keep on track for Summative 2 by revising the relevant topics, and get started on making the video essay. You are capable of getting a very good grade as long as you make sure to engage with the theoretical and analytical aspects of the module. If necessary, feel free to reach out to me for extra help."
Pink,"Unfortunately, you have failed to submit a Formative 2. This leaves me slightly worried as you have not had the chance to practice writing a sociology essay, and I have no way of knowing what your level of essay-writing is like. Please make sure to make the most of the time you have left and try to send me a draft in time for our individual tutorial."

Pink,"Shanqi’s first set of mock exam results have shown that she needs to focus more on her English studies if she is to achieve progression. She did not take the listening exam and as a result this has affected her overall outcome. Although she passed her reading and writing, there is still a lot of room for improvement, and so for the coming summative exams, Shanqi, should take advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare, and seek further support from her AES tutor."
Red,"You give the impression of struggling in Literature, though it is hard for me to comment on your written work as you have not submitted an assignment - leading to your 'red' here. If you wish to achieve a mark that will lead to progression, you have a lot of work to do: you need to start engaging more closely with the course materials and taking a more active part in group work and class discussions, so that you are equipped to do well in your assignments."
Pink,"You are happy to contribute in class, which shows a conscientious attitude, so well done. However, your formative assignment reveals that there is much work to be done if you want to reach the level required for progression, so you need to work very hard in Music if that is to be attainable. You have made some effort to catch up the classes you have recently missed, but have not quite got there yet. All in all, you need to work hard if you want to progress in Music."
Red,"Shanqi is a very quiet student who is reluctant to contribute to class discussions. I would strongly recommend that she tries to do so as engaging in discussion and asking questions is an important way of learning.

Shanqi has taken some time to get familiar with the online learning systems and has not, until recently, engaged with Moodle and the tasks that students are expected to undertake as independent scholarship. It is vital that Shanqi takes responsibility for her learning as we progress.

It is important that Shanqi regularly accesses the text book reading via the RHUL link which she has been sent a number of times.

Shanqi's written work demonstrated some good understanding, and if she follows the feedback provided, her work will improve significantly. I hope that Shanqi feels able to ask for help if she needs it."

Your participation in AES Online tasks has been very good, and I hope that you feel you are benefitting from this. One area to work on is writing. Though it is generally good, to make it even better keep working on those academic conventions we have discussed in class and try to incorporate some of the techniques seen on AES Online to structure and organize your ideas. Keep working at including evidence to support your arguments."
Red,"There is a mixed picture from your work in the Literature module this term. On the one hand, you have made real progress in class, which has been good to see. You have gone from being very quiet to making a real effort to contribute in class discussions (though you often remain quiet in groups). However, you did not submit a formative assignment, and it is for that reason that you receive a 'red' in Literature. This means you have nothing to work from for your summative work next term - and is disappointing to say the least. You will need to improve upon this next term if you want to progress."
Green,"You have made a good start in Music, showing yourself to be a dedicated student. Although your attendance has recently been worrying, when you have been in class you show yourself to be a conscientious student and your answers to questions are insightful. Your assignment was very good and if you take the feedback on board you are in a good place to do very well in your Summative 1. All in all, you should be pleased with a good term's work - well done."
Red,"I am a little concerned about Dexter. I understand that he has been unwell recently and this has meant that he has not been able to keep up with his studies.

Dexter has not been able to submit his formative assignment, so I am unable to comment on the quality of his written work at this stage.

I hope that Dexter returns quickly to full health and is able to re-engage fully with his studies."
Amber,"You are a considerate student who, however, continues to have some difficulty completing his assignments on time. You are respectful towards other students in the classroom as well as the wider student community. You show initiative, and you have demonstrated a positive attitude towards learning. Regarding your academic results, you scored 64% in the Summative Writing Exam, which is, however, too low to meet the RHUL progression criterion of 70% in Writing Skills. This means that you need to improve your academic writing skills in order to do well in CW3 Extended research essay. What is more, you need to make considerable improvement in terms of your reading and research skills and re-sit CW1 Source Report. Therefore, it is recommended that you do the independent study tasks every week, using resources available on the AES Online platform and ask your AES tutor if you have any questions or doubts."
Red,"Unfortunately engagement in this module has proven to be a major hurdle for you. I have as yet to see a written assessment from you (Formative 1, Summative 1, Summative 1 - Resit and Formative 2 were not submitted). This has a major impact on your potential outcome for the module. Your engagement more generally can only be described as patchy. While you do engage in class when present, your independent engagement is far more sporadic, which is a shame as you have real potential."
Green,"Dexter shows promise in Music. He works conscientiously in class and has a good eye for detail, as well as a very good ear, both of which will stand him in good stead for the future. He does not seem overawed by the considerable challenges of studying in a class by himself and has risen to the occasion. However, it would be good to see him engage more consistently asynchronously and match his level of dedication outside the classroom with the level within it."
Pink,"Although your Summative 1 result was good, you have mostly been absent in Term 3 and failed to complete Formative 2. This therefore leaves me slightly worried as you have not had the chance to practice writing a sociology essay.

You have the potential to do well in AES if you continue in the same vein."
Amber,"You have made a very good start in Literature, showing that you are a committed and engaged student. Your contributions in class are not always the most frequent, but some of your ideas are very interesting. Your assignment was not quite as strong as it might have been - and we will discuss that in your tutorial - but there are plenty of ways in which you can improve that. In order to continue being successful next term, you need to carry on working hard, participating in group work and whole-class discussions."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  Your formative assessment demonstrated a high level of creativity and filmmaking skills. You also had excellent attendance. You are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Amber,"Owen has a nearly perfect attendance record. He however does not contribute that much in class and does so only when he is prompted. I believe he needs to show a bit more motivation and determination towards his studies.

Pink,"You have had a mixed term. In class, you have been working hard, especially in the context of group work, where you often do well. However, in larger discussions you are often very quiet, preferring to let others speak. While your Summative 1 mark was good, your Formative 2 mark was much weaker, which is why you have a 'pink' here. We will discuss the reasons for this in your tutorial soon so that you can learn from the experience and do better in your final assignment."
Amber,"This term has been somewhat difficult for you, with many assessments and resits. This has meant that some of your assessments have at times felt rushed. However, now that you have a 4-week break, I strongly recommend you use this time to focus on planning and preparing your S2 portfolio. With some hard work, time management, and motivation, you can certainly achieve a much better grade for this final summative."
Amber,"This term has been somewhat difficult for you, but you have continued to attend every class and engage well, often coming up with very interesting class contributions. Your formative 2 was slightly disappointing, but I do understand that you were very rushed and pressured at that time due to all the assessments and resits piling up. Therefore, I highly recommend you take the Spring break as a very good chance to catch up on all the sociology material and activities in order to plan, research and prepare for the final summative. With more time and some effort from your part, I strongly believe you can achieve better grades for the final summative."

Red,"You are not currently meeting requirements for in-class participation. Over the next few weeks, I want to see you fully engaged, with webcam on and coming up with ideas during breakout room chats and the main class discussion. Use some useful language from AES Online to help you structure your contributions, so you feel confident speaking in the class. In addition, your engagement with online resources has been poor and, as a result, you are falling behind. You need to complete all the mandatory tasks each week, and it would benefit you to do some additional tasks as well. I need to see more effort on your part to be confident of your progression. Significant improvement is required."
Pink,"You are a dedicated student in Literature, regularly contributing to class discussions and making a clear effort in groups as well. Both of these are to be commended. However, your assignment was nothing like as strong - but we will discuss the reasons for that in a tutorial and I have hopes that you will do better in your summative assignment in due course. Hopefully your attitude to the course will stand you in good stead for the remainder of the course."
Pink,"Khalid needs to work very hard to achieve progression. Whilst his submission for the Formative 1 constitutes a very serious case of plagiarism, in his class engagement he has shown a lot of interest in the module. I recommend that he allocates more time on weekly basis to this module to complete the homework and asynchronous activities, as well as the readings. I also advise him to act on the advice he receives on his writing and to seek support in order to improve the quality of his submissions. Having missed some classes now, it is imperative that he allocates some time over the break to catch up with this course."
Red,"Khalid has only attended class once during the last 3 weeks. I understand from Simone Downes that he has health issues. This is a shame as Khalid made a good start to the module. Unfortunately, he has been unable to submit his formative assignment. I hope Khalid makes a quick recovery and is able to resume his studies in the near future"

Red,Emeka did not do the IB Summative 1. He needs to show more interest and enthusiasm in his work. He needs to put more effort and commitment to his studies to do well.
Amber,"Emeka is a student with the potential of doing well. However, he makes very little effort in class and in his assessments. He didn't complete the formative assessment and his summative work was submitted late."
Red,"Emeka is a student with the potential of doing well. However, he makes very little effort in class and in his assessments."
Green,"Emeka has done well in QM. He achieved a fairly good mark in his QM summative 1 assessment. 
However, Emeka must work harder, and he needs to be more keen about his studies."
Green,"Emeka is working towards gaining better grades in his studies. He sometimes participates in class discussion, and he must increase his participation. His has good attendance in general. I have spoken to Emeka, and I am encouraging him to become more involved. No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,Emeka is a student with a lot of potential. He just needs to remain focused and complete the work set out in seminars and workshops. My advice to him would be to work on ensuring he is working hard outside of class to ensure he is stretched and extending his knowledge and understanding.
Amber,"Emeka is an articulate student who has good language skills, but he does not participate in class discussions. He often turns his camera off and this does not help his engagement in his studies. He does answer questions when asked direclty, but his answers show that he needs to develop his understanding.  I recommend that he becomes more involved in class activities to support his studies and his success on this course."
Amber,"Emeka, your attendance and moodle engagement have been good. However, you need to improve on class engagement by contributing to discussions during synchronous activities and taking control of your own learning by reading through lecture slides and prescribed homework before seminars.
Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Green,"Emeka has shown an improvement in his studies as he is becoming more dedicated to his studies. He has gained a first class mark for FDE S1, and hopefully he will continue to keep up this standard."
Amber,
Green,"Emeka has done well in IB, he has scored a very good mark for IB S2, and for the IB S1 resit. He has become more committed to perform well, and  hopefully he will continue with this performance."
Pink,
Amber,
Pink,Emeka has gained a satisfactory mark for his QM S2. He has done  the QM S1 resit  in order to improve his mark. He did improve his mark for S1 a little.

I do feel, however, that he is more than capable of achieving a good overall score in the AES course."
Pink,"Zehui attends his classes and he gained a basic pass for IB summative 1. However, he needs to be more committed to his studies and to work more diligently. He must aim to improve his grades by taking his studies more seriously."
Amber,Zehui doesn't get involved in class and his work shows little or no effort.
Red,Zehui doesn't get involved in class and his work shows little or no effort.
Pink,Zehui gained only a basic pass in the QM summative 1 assessment. Zehui needs to put more effort and commitment to his studies. He needs to work harder to improve his performance.
Green,"Zehui has integrated well into the class and has become a valuable member of the group. He is improving his English language constantly and achieved a reasonable result in the first writing exam. However, it is important that he doesn't miss the next exams as he still has no score for listening and writing."
Green,"Zehui is improving in his studies as he has become more serious with his studies. He has very good attendance and participates in class discussion sometimes, though he can increase his participation. No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,"Zehui does the work but just needs to be consistent with it. My advice to him would be to work on ensuring he is also working hard outside of class to ensure he is stretched and extending his knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Zehui from amber to green."
Amber,"Zehui is a quiet student who does not participate in class discussions. He often turns his camera off and keeping his camera on would be a useful step in improving his engagement. I recommend that he also attempts to answer questions in class. I do understand that this is difficult, but it is an important step in developing his understanding and therefore his success overall."
Amber,"Zehui, your attendance and moodle engagement have been good, but you need to improve on your class engagement as this will help you to sharpen your English language skills and improve your confidence. 
 Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Amber,
Green,"Zehui has shown great improvement in his work, and he has gained  a very good mark for FDE S1 and I expect that he will do quite well in S2."
Amber,
Green,"Zehui is working hard, and he is trying his best. He scored a very good mark for IB S2 showing an improvement in his performance."
Pink,
Amber,
Amber,"Zehui has scored a reasonably good mark for QM S2. He has done the QM S1 resit to improve his mark, and he has done exceedingly well as he has increased his performance by gaining a first class mark for QM S1 resit."

Pink,"Lydia demonstrates satisfactory classroom performance, when present. Her speaking, listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as she has scored below 50% in her reading, listening and writing assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IY1 course. Attending writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She may also benefit from more personalised 1-2-1 support and should, therefore, consider attending drop-In clinics on a regular basis."
Green,"Mina works, but she has had some setbacks on a personal side. She did complete the IB Summative 1 for which she gained a good mark.  She just needs to continue to keep abreast with the studies."
Green,"Lydia started off participating in seminars and discussions. However, halfway through the semester her attendance and involvement went off track. She makes an effort with her assignments but just requires some more practice with her writing.
Furthermore, Lydia's Summative 1 assessment was superb and shows a big turnaround from her previous work."
Red,"Lydia started off participating in seminars and discussions. However, halfway through the semester her attendance and involvement went off track. She makes an effort with her assignments but just requires some more practice with her writing."
Green,"Mina is steadily working and she has achieved a very good mark in her QM summative 1 assessment.
She is committed to succeed and works her way towards success."
Pink,"Lydia tends to be focused on the content in class when present. However, her overall grades are below the overall English language requirement for her chosen degree. She should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. She is advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. Attending writing workshops is recommended. Attending listening workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening and reading exercises, and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve the chances of her progression."
Green,"Lydia is working consistently in her studies. She participates in class discussion and has good attendance in general.  No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,"Lydia gets on with the work and does what is expected of her. My advice to her would be to work on ensuring she is also working hard outside of class to ensure she is stretched and extending her knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Lydia from amber to green."
Amber,Mina is showing some cause for concern. She has not shown good attendance so far this year and when she is in class she does not turn her camera on which is an important step in helping student engagement. She often does not participate in class activities and when asked questions direclty her answers show that her understanding needs to be developed. I recommend that she increases her commitment to class by attending and turning her camera on.
Amber,"Lydia, although your moodle engagement has been good, you need to improve on your attendance which will also improve your class engagement. Note that punctuality provides the opportunity to receive explanation about the concept being taught and you can in turn seek clarification on any difficult areas.
Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Pink,
Amber,Mina's submission of FDE S1 was beyond the 24-hour late deadline.  She has been advised to fill out a mitigating circumstances form to explain her case for this late submission.
Red,
Amber,Mina has scored a reasonable mark for IB S2. If Mina aims to increase her performance in her current studies then this will be beneficial to her.
Pink,
Pink,
Green,"Mina's performance in QM S2 resit has shown that she  has kept up her performance in QM.  She did the S2 resit since she had missed the S2, however she gained a very good mark for S2 resit."

His contributions in speaking activities are always insightful, and he is emerging as one of the leaders of the group.
I think extra work on listening would be of benefit before the first exams and I will endeavour to provide practice opportunities in the class during the coming weeks."
Amber,Bernie is a polite and good student. He tries hard and he gained a fair mark for IB summative 1. He could aim to do better in the next assessment by working harder and going deeper into his studies.
Red,Bernie has shown a lot of improvement since the start of the semester. He is a bit more comfortable talking in class and his writing skills have also improved. Bernie should ensure he answers the questions asked thoroughly.
Green,Bernie has shown a lot of improvement since the start of the semester. He is a bit more comfortable talking in class and his writing skills have also improved.
Green,Bernie works hard and is committed to his studies. He has achieved a good mark in the QM summative 1 assessment.  He must continue to work hard to do his best.

Red,"Fatima is a bright student. Gets involved in class. However, Fatima did not complete her Formative assessment even after an extension and the Summative assessment submitted was not to the level expected."
Green,Fatima is a bright student. Gets involved in class and completes her work to a good standard.
Green,Fatima has done very well in her QM summative 1 as she has gained an excellent mark. This shows her progress in this module and her ambition to do her best.
Green,"Syeda is doing well in her studies, she is working towards success. She participates in class discussion and has good attendance in general.  No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,"Fatima is a good student. She does the work expected of her in seminar and workshop, she just needs to stay focused. My advice to her would be to work on ensuring she is also working hard outside of class to ensure she is stretched and extending her knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,Fatima is a very capable and articulate student. She is now beginning to show very good engagement in class. She is very able to answer questions and contribute to class discussions. Her contributions to class discussions show very good insight. I am very optimistic about her future success on this course.
Amber,"Fatima, at the beginning of the semester, your Moodle and class engagement were not good enough and your camera was turned off during synchronous activities. This changed for the better during the third week and you are encouraged to keep this attitude up. 
As you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Amber,"Syeda tries hard to keep abreast with her studies and assignments, and she has performed reasonably well in the FDE S1. Hopefully she will gain a higher mark in her S2 if she aims to exceed."

Amber,"Nusrat demonstrates a good learning attitude and homework completion. She contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. However, she has scored below the 60% requirement for the IY1 course overall in her listening, reading and writing assessment to date. Given the high entry requirements from RHUL for her chosen degree, she needs to improve her listening, reading and writing skills. Attending writing and reading workshops is recommended. Doing independent activities on listening using resources available to her on the AES Online is likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Nusrat seems to be making progress with the module. However, she has missed one her summative assessment. She has done well in her latest summative assessment and she actively engages with discussions and tasks in class. I am happy to receive questions from her during the session and she has a positive attitude towards her studies which will help her in catching up with the lessons given her attendance rate at 80%. She should make every effort to attend all remaining sessions and continue to engage with class activities and assignments."
Green,Nusrat is a good student who actively participates and contributes to class discussions. She sometimes struggles which could be due to her attendance. She managed to score 55% in SA1 but has the potential to do much better. She has been told about the workshops and that I am also available for extra help or tutorials.
Pink,"Nusrat seems to make some progress with the module, however, she has a lot of potential for improvement with her programming skills. 
I am happy to hear questions from her during sessions when she is present. She has an attendance level of 72% in the module at the moment which is a cause of concern. She should aim to attend all remaining sessions. 
In order to improve her programming skills, she has to take her programming module seriously and practice with the examples and exercises in the notes. She should aim to solve the problems on her own and only check the provided solutions as a tool to evaluate her answers. She can also check the sample solutions in the notes if she is stock in solving a problem for more than 10 minutes. Within the first 10 minutes of solving the problem, she should focus on her abilities to code and identifying potential errors in the code. 
She can also benefit from attending workshop sessions and raising her questions during the workshop session."
Red,"Nusrat has a positive attitude towards her studies and she asks questions when she has one. However, I am concerned with her performance in her latest summative assessments and her level of attendance in classes (72%). I like to hear more from Nusrat in class and I like her to practice with the examples and exercises from weekly notes. She should aim to solve these questions on her own before checking the sample solutions. If possible, she should look into working with one or two of her classmates over Zoom meetings or Teams meetings to practice together and help each other in breaking down the problems into smaller logical bites which can program them. 
She seems to be rushing through questions in the given tasks and hence, her answers does not fully cover the requirements of the problem. She needs to stay focused during the assessments and build her confidence by practice and preparation for assessments."
Green,"Nusrat demonstrates good English language skills and contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. She listens carefully in class and focuses well when working independently or as a group. She is also fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Nusrat has achieved above 60% in overall grades, which is above the English language requirement for her chosen degree and it is a good result for this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!"
Amber,Nusrat missed her S1 due to medical reasons. But she needs to make sure that her attendance is strong in this module as the assessments are taking place every second week. She also needs to work on her attendance and punctuality as she has been late to the sessions couple of times.
Green,Well done. You have passed the module and met your progression requirements.
Green,Well done on successfully passing the module. Keep up the good work in the next semester.
Green,"You have made an excellent start to the module and you seem to be actively engaged in class. Well done, please continue to work hard and maintain your level of performance. You can practice with examples and exercises from the slides and if you need help, please free to ask for questions in class or bring them to the workshop sessions."
Green,"Well done, You have passed and met your progression requirements. You may wish to review and practice with examples and exercises from IY1_OOP I to improve your performance in IY1_OOP II."
Pink,"You have a good level of attendance on the module but it seems like you have plenty of space for improvement in your Python programming. Please practice with the examples and exercises in the slides and watch the recorded sessions. You are more than welcomed to stay in the session at the end of each online class to ask your questions or attend the workshop session to discuss any problems that you couldn't solve on your own. 
I am happy to see that you are active in class. You answer questions and make submissions on Padlet in a timely manner."

Amber,"Haicheng has so far demonstrated a good level of language and this has been reflected in his mock exam results, particularly his listening. Writing is also an area that needs to be strengthened over the coming weeks. He should focus on and practise his academic writing -- look at the feedback and model answers that have been provided in class to help understand the requirements for academic writing. Haicheng seemingly contributes well to group discussion and participates in wider class interaction. Unfortunately, he has been experiencing IT issues with INSENDI and as a result has not been able to participate or engage with weekly tasks - this is currently being resolved."
Amber,"HaiCheng is a polite student and is always keen on learning new topics. HaiCheng is, however, very quiet in class and needs to work on increasing his in-class engagement and participation. HaiCheng just about passed the formative assessment so he needs to take the feedback given on it into account, and work extra hard in his summative assessments."
Amber,"HaiCheng is a quite students and does not volunteer any information, unless asked to do so. HaiCheng received a moderately well grade in his formatives, but needs to work on improving his cohesion as well as the quality and relevance of his information. HaiCheng is able to achieve much more with the right skills and tools."
Amber,"HaiCheng has improved quite a lot since the start of the term. But he is yet to become comfortable in openly contributing to the class discussions. He has the knowledge, he just needs to gain the confidence and start speaking up. This will help elevate his analysing and evaluating skills."
Amber,"HaiCheng is a quiet, yet receptive, student who works hard in this module. HaiCheng, overall, lacks confidence at times, and needs to work on being more engaging in class. HaiCheng scored moderately well in his formative assessment, so he should continue working hard and put more effort into building his confidence in class."

Amber,"Haicheng's first set of summative exam results show that there is room for improvement, particularly his writing as he achieved 44%. Unfortunately, his result for CW1 was unusually low, and I hope that he is intending to resubmit, otherwise he is at risk of not progressing to year 2. For now, I have awarded an amber as I am hopeful that he will reach progression. So moving forward Haicheng should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals, and act upon the feedback given to him by his AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to his performance."
Pink,"HaiCheng is a polite student and is always keen on learning new topics. HaiCheng is, however, very quiet in class and needs to work on increasing his in-class engagement and participation. He also needs to work on his attendance and on submitting assessments on time."
Amber,"Haicheng needs to keep up with the work and participate more in seminars/workshops. He needs to ensure he fully understands the topics covered. To help him with this, he should be engaging in creating mind-maps of all the concepts and ideas being explored in class and use this as part of his revision. Practising calculations outside of class is also essential to secure higher grades and move from amber to green. I am happy to provide him with exercises and suggest he reaches out to me for tutorials where I can guide him better."
Pink,"HaiCheng is a quiet student and does not volunteer any information, unless asked to do so. HaiCheng needs to work on being more regular in class if he wants to pass this module with a good grade. HaiCheng should also ask for help from his tutors if he feels like he is struggling in a particular topic."
Pink,"HaiCheng is a quiet, yet receptive, student who works hard in this module. HaiCheng, overall, lacks confidence at times, and needs to work on being more engaging in class. HaiCheng also needs to work on his attendance in seminars and his confidence when participating in various seminar activities."
Red,You did not submit the resit for summative 2.
Amber,"I have had little opportunity to work with Haicheng so far, but he has attended every lesson and appears committed to improving in AES."
Green,"Haicheng has joined my FDE classes this semester, and he is progressing well so far. He is participating in discussion when I call upon him. His attendance is good in general. No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,"Haicheng does the work but just needs to be consistent with it. My advice to him would be to work on ensuring he is also working hard outside of class to ensure he is stretched and extending his knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Haicheng from amber to green."
Amber,"Haicheng is a very quiet student in class. I would suggest that Haicheng should now increase his engagement in classes. His participation in class discussions is minimal and he should attempt to increase his involvement in class activities. I would also suggest that he asks questions when he is unsure of his understanding. I appreciate that this is difficult for some students, but unless he tries he will not develop his capabilities."
Amber,"Haicheng, although your attendance and moodle engagement have been good, you need to improve on your class engagement by contributing to discussions and asking questions for clarification where necessary.
Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Amber,
Red,"Haicheng has joined my FDE module this semester.  He did not attempt the FDE S1, and hopefully he will do the S1 resit. I did send a note to him about this, but I did not hear back from him."

Amber,"He has attended about half of the classes and needs to improve his attendance.  He has shown his potential and worked well when he joined the discussion. Nevertheless, his results are not as good as they could be because he does not alway put enough effort into his work. He should show more determination to do well in his studies.  It seems difficult for him to demonstrate his subject knowledge when taking exams/working on assignments and his mock exam results are poor. He should complete the activities on AES Online and start planning his CW1."
Amber,"I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Fairly active during the class. However, I am changing your feedback color to Amber as your attendance rate is concerning (59%) and you have failed to submit some of your assignments. Your mark for summative assessment  2 is also a little concerning when compared to summative 1 and shows that you may not have been working hard enough since summative 1. I strongly believe that you should not miss any more classes. I would like you to be more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I want you to make sure that you will not miss any other assignment/quiz."
Amber,"I believe your progress in this module is average. Good attendance record. Although, your mark for summative assessments 1 is concerning. I am changing your feedback color to Amber because I am concerned with your engagement in the class. I would like you to be more active and focused during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I think you can further improve your performance by being focused and engaged during the class. I also recommend you to practice maths by solving multiple examples and exercises from the slides and the textbook. I believe more practice is going to help you perform better in your next assessments. I also want you to be serious about your assignments and quizzes."
Amber,Fadhel has to put more effort into learning to code and needs considerable practice with implementing plenty of programming projects. Should engage more actively in class discussions and be more proactive in group tasks/activities.
Amber,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

He does not consistently make a reasonable effort and lacks motivation. He should be more focused on his aims and work harder to achieve them.  He has shown his potential and worked well at times. Nevertheless, his results are not as good as they could be because he does always not put enough effort into his work. He should show more determination to do well in his studies."
Pink,Fadhel has to improve his participation and attendance to succeed in this module. He has a positive attitude when present and attending the sessions. He has worked on developing the web page but needs to be consistent. Fadhel failed to appear for SA1 but has appeared recently for SA2. He needs to make sure that he does not miss out on these important assessments.
Pink,"You have not submitted Assessment 1 and 2. Please pay extra attention to these assignments as they do contribute to the final grade. You will progress faster by spending more time studying, including going over the materials on Moodle, revising what you have learnt, working on the exercises and practise coding with Java.

Green,"You have made some progress. You will progress faster by attending all the classes, spending more time studying, including going over the materials on Moodle, revising what you have learnt, working on the exercises and practise coding using Python. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly and be sure to spend time working on assignments to submit them on time."
Pink,"You seem to be making some progress with the module, and you seems to have a positive attitude towards your studies. However, your latest performance in the summative assessment indicates further potential for improvement. Please review the examples and exercises in the notes and make every attempt to attend all remaining sessions. During each session, I like to hear from you with constructive input in the discussions and volunteering for representing your group in group discussions. 
Please read the recommended pages from the textbook as instructed in the lessons and practice with examples in the textbook. 
Feel free to join your friends in group studies on Teams. I am expecting a study plan from you with details of hours of study allocated for each module during the week. You should take your studies seriously and review your study routines and techniques to improve your performance. 
I am confident that if you work hard and attend your classes, you will be able to pass and progress."

Pink,"Ilya demonstrates a good learning attitude and homework completion most of the time. His listening, reading and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Ilya is a good student who shows a lot of confidence and capability in class. He is often at the forefront of class discussions and his insight shows good understanding. 

His formative result was a little disappointing, but I think that is because he will take some time to channel his abilities into the university style of learning. If he is able to adapt his approach I am confident that Ilya will go on to a successful outcome this year."
Green,"96% on F1 - well done! Sometimes get distracted but mostly a very positive student who always does his homework, asks questions and answers well in class. Please check workings for errors."
Amber,"You are a pleasure to teach and show engagement in class, which is very good. You also demonstrate a sound command of the subject and this is clear from your most recent formative assessment score, which was 58%. You do need to put in more effort though in order to succeed and you do need to stretch yourself further. Improve your performance by following all the asynchronous actives on Moodle and memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. This should help you improve your scores further."

Pink,"Ilya tends to be focused on the content in class and shows a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. However, his overall grades are below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree and he missed the listening and writing mock exams. He should work hard to keep up with the progression requirements. He is advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. Attending writing workshops is still recommended. Attending listening workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of his progression."
Amber,"Ilya is a talented student, but his attendance and commitment have been reducing during term 2. He is obviously capable, but if he cannot focus on his studies then he will risk progression at the end of the year. However, his summative 1 result was good.

Ilya's key challenge now is to maintain his energy and commitment until the end of the course. He should start by doubling his efforts to attend class and re-establish his participation which was good during term 1."
Green,"96% in F1, 83% in F2, 66% in S1. This is a capable student. He needs to ensure he catches up on class material missed recently. Also, he needs to ensure he attends class from a quiet working environment. Despite some personal difficulties, on the whole, this student has worked hard to achieve such good results, so keep up this hard work in the future, as well as increasing your motivation in class participation."
Amber,"You show some engagement in class, and this is good. You also demonstrate a good command of the subject, which is clear from your most recent summative assessment score, which was 66%. Moving forward, complete all the asynchronous activities on Moodle and memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook which will help improve assessment scores if you include these (appropriately) in your answers."
Red,"Ilya demonstrates good learning attitudes when present in class. However, he has missed almost all the live sessions this term and missed all the summative reading, listening and writing exams as well as the meetings with me on his study plan. He should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. Attending live sessions, speaking more English, doing extensive listening, reading and writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. It is also imperative that he attends all the AES workshops on a regular basis."

It is also obvious that he puts considerable effort into his studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. In terms of the assessments, his overall results on wiseflow exams are very good but he has not attended the seminar discussion. He can start searching for sources for CW1 and read these sources during the term break."

Your marks for summative assessments 1 and  2 are also satisfactory and shows that you have been working hard. Please keep up the good work.

I also recommend you to practice maths by solving multiple examples and exercises from the slides and the textbook. My only concern is that during the last weeks you have been a little distracted during our sessions, please try to remain focused and engaged."
Amber,"Lately, Talha seems to have lost a bit his touch with the modules. He will definitely progress faster by doing more studying out of class, including going over the materials on Moodle, finishing exercises that are set, and working on the exercises on other learning resources such as the Coding Bat website."
Amber,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1.

He is making good progress and should aim to maintain or even improve on this going forward. His performance in exams is satisfactory, but should improve his listening and writing skills."
Amber,"Talha has had issues with his attendance but recently he has become more consistent. He needs to keep up with this positive attitude towards his studies.

In terms of his speaking, he is a little on the quiet side in group discussions and so this is an area to work on in the coming weeks. He should try to make more contributions and try to take on the role of an active participant. More consistent engagement with the online English platform will further help him understand the specifics of academic English in more detail."
Amber,"I am generally happy with your progress in this module as your marks for summative assessments  1 and 2 are satisfactory. However, I am keeping your feedback color as Amber because I am very concerned with your engagement in the class. You seem very distracted during the class and cannot answer my questions. Also, you have missed most of the workshops. I would like you to be more active and focused during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I want you to make sure that you will not miss any assignment/quiz. I think you can further improve your performance by being focused and engaged during the class. Moreover, you should not miss any of the workshops as they are currently mandatory for you."

Amber,"Seonghun's first set of summative exam and assessment results have been mixed with fails in his reading exam and CW1. Unless he truly focuses on improving his reading and resubmitting CW1, he is at risk of not achieving progression. He did, however, perform reasonably well in his listening and speaking/ seminar and these are skills which could also be further strengthened through practise exercises. For now, I have awarded Seonghun a pink due to his fails, but I remain optimistic that he will reach progression if he applies himself. So moving forward Seonghun should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals, and act upon the feedback given to him by his AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to his performance."
Green,Seonghun has a positive attitude towards his studies and his attendance is excellent so far. He actively completes his work and puts in a good level of effort to learn. He needs to work on his participation in class and group activities. He managed to score 71% in SA1 but has the potential to achieve better.

Amber,"Overall, Shafay’s first set of mock exam results have been very pleasing. He achieved over 60% in his listening, reading and speaking, however an area that he needs to focus on is his writing in which he achieved below the progression mark of 50%. For the coming summative exams, I strongly recommend that Shafay take advantage of the reading and writing exam practice that are on the online English platform to help him prepare, and seek further support from his AES tutor."
Amber,"You have really developed over the course of the term, which has been a delight to see. At the start of the term, you were reticent to contribute in class, but you have been conscientious and changed this, especially with the help of the chat box. Your assignment mark shows that you have some way to go if you want to achieve your progression aim. However, you have the right attitude to ensure that you can improve, so carry on working hard!"
Amber,"Even though Shafay's submission for the Formative 1 was rather weak, he has shown a lot of commitment to improve his knowledge, understanding, writing and research skills. Shafay is conscientious and hardworking. He has always submitted his homework and asynchronous activities on time and has been very engaged in the class discussions. I recommend that he allocates more time to improve his academic writing and acts upon the feedback he has been given on his written assignments."
Green,"Shafay is an able student who has a good grasp of the concepts in the module

I would reommend that Shafay needs to spend longer on preparing his assignments. His formative assignment was rather short which meant that he was unable to develop and elaborate on a number of points.

If Shafay takes note of the feedback, he has the potential to improve significantly.

Shafay makes some helpful contributions to class discussions. I would encourage him to participate more."
Pink,"Shafay’s summative exams have shown that his speaking and reading (58%) to be his strongest language skills. However, listening and writing are skills that require strengthening as he did not achieve a pass grade. Thus, to help him prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help him reach progression. In addition, he should focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result, and consider resubmitting CW1 in the resit period to help boost his reading grade."
Red,"Unfortunately, despite hard work, your outcomes in this module leave a lot to be desired. Your Summative 1 was not strong and your Summative 1 Resit was unfortunately weaker. Your Formative 2 also showed little improvement and in some of these assignments there was a worrying pattern of plagiarism, which you must address if you wish to score more highly. In class, it is clear that you are working hard, but if you wish to turn things around, you need to ensure that you devote sufficient time and effort to your written work. This is especially important with Summative 2 on the horizon."
Pink,"Shafay has shown a lot of interest in and engagement with this class. Unfortunately, his progress is threatened by the poor quality of writing, and in particular of very poor paraphrasing skills. I recommend a more rigorous approach to researching and wider reading. Most importantly, Shafay needs to invest more time into preparation and address as fastly as possible the issues raised by his writing."
Pink,"While your summative 1 result was slightly disappointing, what has been very positive to see is your attitude and motivation in wanting to improve. If you continue working hard and manage time your well, you can definitely achieve better grades in your S2.

Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Amber,Mustafa is a good student who gets involved in class activities. He sometimes has to be prompted to speak in class. His assessments could do with some improvement just to ensure he progresses.
Green,"Mustafa is hardworking, and he has achieved a very good mark in his QM summative 1 assessment.
He is conscientious and shows his zeal to succeed in his studies. Keep up the good work."
Green,"Mustafa is a conscientious student, and he takes his work very seriously. He keeps abreast  with his studies, and he has good attendance in general. No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,"Mustafa does the work but just needs to be consistent with it. My advice to him would be to work on ensuring he is also working hard outside of class to ensure he is stretched and extending his knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Mustafa from amber to green."
Pink,I am concerned about Mustafa as he has not attended more than 40% of classes since the start of the module. When he is in class he shows poor engagement and does not get involved with class discussions or activities. He also needs to turn his camera on in class to help his engagement. I suggest that he takes steps to increase his motivation for his studies or it will have an effect on his overall success.
Amber,"Mustafa,  your attendance and moodle engagement have been good, but you need to improve on your class engagement as this will help you to sharpen your English language skills and improve your confidence. 
 Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."

Green,"Taikhum is an enthusiastic student. He always does the work expected from him and is very involved in discussions. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars.

Amber,Taikhum is a very positive student who seems to enjoy the classes. He is able to answer questions and to some extent participates in class discussions. I have some concerns about his engagement in class as he often turns his camera off and seems to be doing other things during class. In order to succeed he needs to address these issues.
Pink,"Taikhum, your attendance and class engagement have not been the best because you are usually distracted due to your location during synchronous activities. This can mitigate against your ability to excel, although you have the potential. You must work towards improving these and as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."

Pink,
Pink,"Can demonstrates a good learning attitude and homework completion. His listening, reading and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below 30% in his listening and reading assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Can is a good student who shows good interest in the topic. He is also generally engaged in class and offers his viewpoint in class discussions. However, his formative result shows that he still has some way to go to develop his capabilities over the course of the year in order to progress.

Can needs to consider the feedback he has been given and increase the energy that he is putting into his studies. If he can do this then I am confident that he has the capability to succeed this year."
Pink,"You show some interest in class but need to put in much more effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussions. Your attendance is patchy at best and this is not helping your chances of succeeding. Your score for your formative 1 assessment was just 40% and so it is clear that you need to improve your engagement and work. Alongside limited subject knowledge, you also have difficulty in applying Economics concepts to your assessments. To improve you need to complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook and practice writing your understanding of key concepts in your own words. You can submit short answers to me and every week, you need to be ready to share your notes with me, so I can see the work you are doing."
Amber,"54% on F1. Essay in F1 was an improvement on his previous essay. He is attempting to engage more. Previously, he was very distracted and couldn't answer my questions in class. But I had a tutorial with him to discuss this, as well as Chris (head of AES) making a study plan for Efe Can to improve. Efe Can working much harder now and working with AES on his English to be more able to use evaluation in essays. Efe Can also started late so it is harder to catch up."

Attending listening workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of his progression."
Amber,"Can has shown some issues this term with attendance which has reduced a great deal. He is also less engaged and energised in class than he was last term. His summative 1 resit result was good, but I remain very concerned about his ability to complete the course as the subject matter becomes more challenging. Can needs to really ask himself if he is committed to succeeding and then apply himself to attending class and working on his studies."
Amber,"Efe Can -You are showing increased interest in our class are making an effort to communicate and participate in group discussions. Your workshop attendance has improved but there is still room for improvement (and consistency). Over the Easter break, you need to complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook and practice writing a definition of key concepts in your own words."
Amber,"60% in S1, which is a large improvement on previous essays. This student has made a lot of improvement both in terms of essay writing and class engagement. Keep up the good work.
30% in F2 which means this student needs to learn how to write lab reports by S2 deadline. He will be given lab report tasks to practice."
Amber,"Efe shows good learning attitudes and actively contributes to class discussions, when present. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. His reading and writing skills, however, need further development. I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Attending reading and writing workshops and drop-in sessions, doing extensive reading and writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. He is also advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a good completion rate."

Amber,"Xinjun participates and engages well in class as well as on the online English platform. He has achieved over 40% in his first set of mock exams, but missed his speaking seminar exam. He does, however, demonstrate competent communication skills when involved in wider class discussion, and so based on what I have seen so far I believe he will do well in his upcoming speaking exam. Areas to focus on and practise are his reading and writing - refer to the materials given in class to help understand the requirements of academic English."
Amber,"Xinjun is a polite and helpful student, and he is often the one helping other students who may have technical issues. Xinjun is receptive of feedback and consciously makes the effort to improve his work. However, Xinjun received a moderately passing mark in his formative assessment so needs to work in accordance with the feedback given, in order to score a higher mark in his summative assessments."
Amber,"Xinjun contributes well in class and often has some interesting points to add to the discussion. Xinjun needs to work on his quality and relevance on information, as indicated by his formative assessment score where scored only moderately well. If he can improve these points, Xinjun can achieve much higher grades in this module."
Amber,"Xinjun has exceeded my expectations in terms of class engagement. He has become more confident and more opinionated, as well good at doing self-reflection. He is usually able to answer my questions in class and positively contribute to the discussion. I think Xinjun would benefit from practising self-reflection in his own time and developing the skills he already has."
Pink,"Xinjun is attentive in class and often contributes in discussions, albeit it is rare. Xinjun needs to spend more time on Quantitative Methods as he did not pass his formative assessment.

For now, I have awarded Xinjun an amber as I am optimistic that he will reach progression as long as he applies himself. So moving forward Xinjun should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals, and act upon the feedback given to him by his AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to his performance."
Green,"Xinjun is a polite and helpful student, and he is often the one helping other students who may have technical issues. Xinjun is receptive of feedback and consciously makes the effort to improve his work. His quality of work has dramatically improved, as compared to last semester, and the extra effort he is putting in really showed in resits."
Amber,"Xinjun has been working really well. Just needs to be more confident and ensure the topics are fully understood. He needs to ensure he fully understands the topics covered. To help him with this, he should be engaging in creating mind-maps of all the concepts and ideas being explored in class and use this as part of his revision. Practising calculations outside of class is also essential to secure higher grades and move from amber to green. I am happy to provide Xinjun with exercises and suggest he reaches out to me for tutorials where I can guide him better."
Green,"Xinjun contributes well in class and often has some interesting points to add to the discussion. Xinjun has improved his quality and relevance on information overall, and now should focus on the structure of his written work. Xinjun also does not hesitate to ask for help which greatly benefits him."
Amber,"Xinjun is attentive in class and often contributes in discussions, more often than the last semester. Xinjun needs to spend more time on organisational studies, specifically on theories and other concepts that are unclear. Xinjun has the potential to achieve a good grade in this module if he tries hard enough."
Green,Good performance in this module. You struggled with summative 1 but worked hard and showed a great improvement in summative 2. Well done and continue to apply the quantitative and problem-solving skills acquired in semester 2 and beyond.

Green,"Your assignment mark in Literature is excellent and as Christos and I have seen in the workshops, you have, in reality, a very strong understanding of what we have covered in the Literature module, so well done. However, this does not mean that there are not areas for you to work on: as we have already discussed, it would be good to hear more from you in class. I have seen efforts from you on this front, but I want you to keep up this momentum as it will make your performance more even, meaning that you are better prepared for your next assignments."
Green,"There is a mixed picture for you in music. You are extremely reluctant to participate in class, unless directly asked. When we have discussed this you have said it is due to a lack of confidence and I have suggested a number of strategies to help you with this, which you are not necessarily employing: it would be good to see this in the New Year. However, it is clear that there is excellent work going on: you did very well in your assignment and when you do participate in discussions your contributions are clear and apposite."
Amber,"Tata's record of attendance has been excellent. He does not participate that much in class and does so only when prompted, but when he does so his engagement is always successful. He is a conscientious student and was able to seek help and assistance through workshops, which have been helpful for him in order to become more confident.
His formative assessment was good, but I am certain he will be able to improve on this in the Summative with the help he has been given in the workshop. He needs to continue with the same determination and I am sure he will be able to progress."

Amber,"Tata is a self-motivated student who is committed to doing his best. What is more, it can be said that the student tackles class assignments, tasks, and group work in an organised manner. He expresses his ideas clearly and can make a logical and persuasive argument. However, in order to achieve the required progression mark of 70% in Writing, Tata should continue to work on improving his writing skills throughout term 3 with the use of Mock Exams as well as independent study tasks available on the AES Online platform every week."
Green,"You have worked hard in Literature. You remain somewhat quiet in classes, something we have spoken about previously, but this is something that is gradually improving so well done. Your assignment marks have consistently been very strong, which has been a delight to see and puts you in a very good place for your summative work next term. Overall, you should be very pleased with your term's work."
Green,"Your work in Music continues to be consistently strong, and you are starting to reap the rewards of that with assignment marks that are also consistently excellent - well done. As ever, the main area for you to work on is your participation in class. While this is improved, you could still continue to work on it. However, you should be pleased with your work in Music overall and your results show that."
Green,"You have had a very good term, as demonstrated by your grades which have been getting better and better. Also very impressive have been your contributions in class, although you do need a little bit of prompting, but when you do speak what you say is always clear, correct, and demonstrates knowledge and critical thinking. What would be very nice to see is for you to have a bit more confidence in coming forward to speak yourself even more. Do also try to keep on top of the homework and asynchronous activities, which will continue to enhance your sociological knowledge for your written assessments. Overall, you have worked very hard this term and should be proud of your work, please keep it up."

Pink,"Xinyi's first set of mock exam results have not been very satisfactory and it shows that greater attention should be given to practise her English skills, particularly her writing as she did not achieve a pass mark. She also needs to participate and engage with the online English platform as this will help her better understand the specifics of academic English in more detail. I believe that Xinyi is capable of much more as long as she applies herself and asks any questions that she may have to help her achieve progression."
Green,You have a positive attitude and always ready to learn but you need to build a little more confidence through contributions during seminars without being pushed to do so.
Pink,Xinyi is showing some cause for concern. She does not participate in class discussions and is generally unable to answer questions when asked. Her summative result was reflective of this. Xinyi needs to really think about improving her english in order to support her efforts to succeed this year.

Pink,"Xinyi's first set of summative exam and assessment results have been very mixed with fails in listening and writing, and CW1; and unless she truly focuses on improving these skills she is at risk of not achieving progression. She did, however, perform reasonably in her speaking/ seminar and her reading. These are skills which could also be strengthened through practise exercises. So moving forward, Xinyi, should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help her prepare for her finals, and act upon the feedback given to her by her AES tutor because by doing so will definitely make huge improvements in performance."
Amber,Your attendance and moodle engagement have been good so far  but you need to improve on your engagement in class to improve on your confidence and English language skills.
Green,"Xinyi is working at the level expected, should be on track for progression. Now, my advice would be for her to stretch herself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, you need to carefully consider the feedback from your summatives to improve on your writing, analytical and evaluation skills for the modules in semester 2."
Pink,
Green,"Satisfactory performance in this module. However, there is more room for improvement so work towards higher grades in the second semester."
Pink,"Xinyi has some capabliity, but lacks focus and engagement in class. She often turns her camera off and does not participate in class discussions or activities as well as most other students. I strongly recommend to Xinyi that she increases her focus in class which will both increase her enjoyment of her studies and also improve her chance of success this year."
Amber,"Your attendance and contribution in class have been commendable. However, you need to improve on your moodle engagement because that is where the learning materials for this module can be found."

His listening, reading and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below 35% in his listening and reading assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IY1 course. Attending listening and writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. He would also benefit from completing all of the homework on the AES platform."
Green,Your engagement with both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be impressive.
Pink,Dian shows some cause for concern. He does not make any impact on classes when he attends and is unable to answer questions when challenged. His formative assignment work was very poor and this shows that he is having difficulty understanding the material on the course. Neither did he attend a tutorial. Overall I am very concerned that Dian will not be able to successfully complete the course.

Amber,"Dian is working consistently and just needs to keep up with that. My advice to him would be to work on ensuring he is also working hard outside of class to ensure he is stretched and extending his knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Dian from amber to green."
Green,Your performance in this module has been satisfactory but you need to resit summative 2 because you did not make the pass mark of 40%. Consider the feedback received carefully to improve on the resit submission.
Pink,
Green,Good performance in this module. Keep it up.
Pink,Dian gives me some concern as he is not fully engaging with his studies. He often turns his camera off in class and appears to be absent when he attends class. Dian needs to reflect on why he is on the course and then increase the energy and focus that he is applying to his studies.
Green,"Your attendance, class and moodle engagement for this module have been good and it is exciting to note that your contribution during seminars have improved from the situation last semester. Keep up with this and utilise the learning materials available on moodle."

He is a pleasure to have in class, and participates and engages well. His mock exam results have shown some good English language skills, although writing is an area that needs to be strengthened over the coming weeks. One other area is his engagement with the online English platform on which I would like him to complete the screens as instructed each week -- by doing so will help him better understand the specifics of academic English in more detail."
Green,"Your engagement with synchronous and asynchronous activities have improved significantly since the last RPAG.
You need to pay attention to the feedback received for the formative assessment to improve on your subsequent submissions."
Green,Baizhen is a studious student who takes his work seriously. Although he does not normally participate in class discussions he is very able to answer questions when asked. His formative work was good and this is to be expected from a student like Baizhen. I would like to see him participate more fully in class as this would develop his understanding and knowledge. I am optimistic about his future on the course.

and affected his participation in class. He performed well in his speaking/ seminar exam - his strongest skill, however his other exam results are not reflective of his English language ability owing to Internet connectivity issues which prevented his full participation. His CW1 result was a little disappointing, and he could have achieved a much better score. Moving forward, Baizhen should do well providing he keeps working diligently in all of his forthcoming AES exams and assignments."

He often turns off his camera and does not participate in class as well as he should. This is a shame for Baizhen as he would benefit from more focus, but also the rest of the class would benefit from his involvment. I am sure that Baizhen will succeed this year, but it would be much better if he took maximum advantage of the opportunity to learn."

You had problems accessing the AES platform and so you have not completed enough activities. However, you have improved towards the end of term. Please go back and complete more of the activities so you have a good understanding of the key concepts in AES. You did not take any AES exams in the middle of term, so I do not have sufficient information to be confident in your abilities to pass AES at this point."
Pink,"Felix got 40% in F1. He often attends class from distracting locations. I have made comments about this a few times and he always apologises but you need to make sure you actually attend classes from appropriate locations always. Also, Felix is often late to class. Felix does have some understanding of maths. However, he needs to spend time going over previous lessons in order to jog his memory. Please review partial factors."
Pink,"This student needs to engage more. He keeps trying to attend class from locations like a photo studio or a train which is distracting. He got 40% on his F1 essay. I have previously emailed him questions asking to summarise some of the topics studied. He did so, reasonably well. Also, I have arranged for Chris (Head of AES) to talk with him. After that talk, Felix has engaged in AES classes to improve his overall English/evaluative skills. He is working on a plan with AES moving forward."
Amber,"Felix has attended the majority of classes. He however does not engage much in class and even if prompted he has trouble with verbalising his thoughts. His formative assessment was good. Felix is currently doing workshop work with AES. Based on the fact that he was able to present some interesting evidence and knowledge from further literature, with AES help he should be able to do better in his Summative."

Pink,"Felix needs to make some serious improvements if he is planning to pass AES and progress to his chosen UG programme at RHUL. The student needs to work hard in order to achieve the required progression mark of 60% in AES (overall). Felix’s writing skills seem to be the weakest point for him – considering his low score in the last mock writing exam (28%). Therefore, Felix should continue to work on improving his academic writing skills throughout term 3 with the use of Mock Exams, he must attend Writing Workshops and complete independent study tasks available on the AES Online platform every week."
Amber,"Felix has worked hard. His F1 grade was 42% and S1 was 49% but for F2 grade, he got 57% which shows his improvement. He needs to keep up the good work in order to ensure further improvement and to review his notes to jog his memory."
Amber,"This student has made a lot of improvement, with a S1 resit of 52%. However, this student still struggles with complex psychology concepts and evaluation and needs to keep working to make even more improvement in the future."
Pink,"Overall, this has been a difficult term for you. I have seen some improvement in terms of class engagement, but where you still struggle is remembering the concepts and terminology. You need to make notes and learn actively during lectures and seminars. This will then help you know what to write about in your assessments, which so far have achieved rather disappointing grades. But all this can be improved upon with a bit more organisation from your part. Keep on top of the lecture notes by revising each week, and start to engage with homework and asynchronous activities. If you use the Spring break to do this, then you have every chance of achieving better grades in the final summative."

This in itself would not necessarily be an issue, but his summative 1 result was 54 and this raises a concern that he may not be able to amass the necessary marks in order to progress. He now needs to consider his focus and in particular go back over material covered in term 2 so far to ensure that he has a clear understanding."
Amber,"74% in F1, 47% in F2, 61% in S1. This student is often quiet and does not answer questions in class. Tim should work to be more motivated during group work as well as revise his notes over Easter break."
Amber,"Ting-Yao - You show some interest in class, but you need to make more of an effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussions in breakout rooms. Your summative 1 assessment score is 62%. It shows you are capable of achieving progression, but you need to continue working hard so as not to slip backwards. My advice would be for you to spend Easter completing all and any asynchronous actives you have missed on Moodle."
Pink,"Tim demonstrates good learning attitudes when present in class. However, he has scored well below 40% in his summative assessments except speaking, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. He missed the summative writing exams.

In the future, I suggests planning your essay, using appropriate linking words to connect your paragraphs together, as well as checking the Harvard referencing guide to improve your referencing skills."
Amber,"Eeman has attended most of the classes, but she needs to improve on her attendance. She participates constantly during discussions and makes valuable contributions in class. Her Formative assignment was good/very good but I believe she has the capabilities to do much better. She needs  to show a bit more determination and motivation and most certainly she will be able to progress."

Amber,"Eeman shows good learning attitudes and actively contributes to all class discussions, when present. She has made satisfactory progress so far this term. Her reading and writing skills, however, need further development. I also advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She is also advised to complete her AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate."
Green,"86% in F1, 88% in F2, 80% in S1. This student is dilligent and works hard, as reflected in all her grades. She should do her best to keep up this positive rhythm in the future. Sometimes Eeman is late or has connection issues or is unable to attend which makes it harder for her participate in class."
Green,"62% in S1. This is an improvement on the F1 work. Eeman is very engaged and asks many questions and answers my questions in class and participates well in group discussion. She needs to keep up the hard work, to keep improving further."
Amber,"Overall you have worked hard and remained a motivated student throughout this term, but you have had some difficulties as well. At times other issues meant you could not attend classes, or connection problems have stopped you from being able to participate. All this means you are faced with quite a lot of material to catch up on. Please use the Spring break to revise and catch up on all the sociology materials and activities, and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. With some revision and catching up, I have every belief that you can continue to achieve higher grades moving into the final summative."
Green,"Well on track. Eeman demonstrates good learning attitudes and actively contributes to all class discussions, when present. She listens carefully in class and focuses well when working independently or as a group. She is also fully engaged in class and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. Eeman has achieved above 60% in her overall grades, which is above both the overall English language requirement and the sub-requirement in writing for her chosen degree. I am sure she will keep up the good work and do well in the upcoming summative assessments. She is also advised to complete her AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate."

Amber,"Nicholas demonstrates a good learning attitude and homework completion. However, he has scored slightly below the 60% requirement for the IY1 course overall in his listening, reading and writing assessment to date. Attending listening and writing workshops is recommended. Doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to her on the AES platform is likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,Your engagement with both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be impressive.
Green,Nicholas is a very committed student and shows a great deal of attention and focus in class. He is able to answer questions when asked and although at times he needs support understanding more advanced topics he shows an excellent attitude to learning. His formative result was good and I am optimistic about his future success on the course.
Green,You have continued to maintain a good attitude. Please implement the comments received for your formative assessments to improve on your summatives.

Green,"Your attitude towards your academic work in terms of attendance, class and moodle engagement have been very good. Please keep this up moving forward. Ensure you are stretching yourself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Nicholas is working at a good level and should progress just fine. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, you need to carefully consider the feedback from your summatives to improve on your writing, analytical and evaluation skills for the modules in semester 2."
Green,
Green,Good performance in this module. Keep it up.
Green,Nicholas is a very good student who is very focussed and motivated about his studies. He contributes well to class activities and it is obvious from his approach that he is enjoying his time at university. I am very optimistic about his success this year and expect him to do well overall.
Green,"Good attendance, moodle and class engagement in this module so far. Your contribution in class has been particularly commendable. Keep up with this and make good use of the materials available on moodle to help with your preparation for your assessments."
Green,Very good performance in this module.  You struggled with summative 1 but worked hard and showed a great improvement in summative 2. Well done and continue to apply the quantitative and problem-solving skills acquired in semester 2 and beyond.

I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!"
Amber,"Cheuk is a brilliant students who is one of the top contributors in class. However, she scored quite poorly in the formative assessment. She needs to put as much effort in her submitted work as she does in her class room contribution, and deeply follow the feedback provided in the formative assessment so as to gain better results in her summative assessments."
Green,"Cheuk is one of the brightest students in this class. She is excellent a using different audio/visual support in presentations and work well both individually and in a team. Cheuk received a good grade for her formative assessment, and should keep up her current learning strategy."
Green,"Cheuk is quite active in class and always contributes positively to all discussions. She has also gotten into the habit of asking questions when she is stuck or if she does not understand something. Her asking not only helps her but also her classmates who are too shy to ask. I think she should continue with her performance, and I have quite high expectations from her for this year."
Pink,"Cheuk is an active and enthusiastic student, who responds well to the module and works hard at understanding the various statistical theories. However, Cheuk failed her formative assessment (at 36%) which means she will need to put more effort into the module and dedicate more time into practicing the word problems. Cheuk has the potential to do much better in this module, based on her class engagement and participation."

Pink,"You have attended our live sessions well and sometimes you participate well.  You have also been quite good at completing the activites on the AES platform. Make sure you use the live sessions to ask questions for anything you don't understand. You took most of the exams inthe middle of the term but I am keen to see you complete all of them in week 10 so we can get a clear picture of your strengths and weaknesses. Also, make sure the camera can see your full face during the exams."
Green,"Your progress this term has been considerable - and has really come into its own over the last couple of weeks, so well done. At the start of the term it was clear you lacked confidence, but the last couple of weeks have seen you take a much more active role in discussion-based tasks which has been a delight to see. Your group work has also improved - and all of this has been evident in the strength of the assignment which you submitted, which was very good: well done. All in all, to carry on being successful you need to build on the work you have done this term. Carry on reading and asking questions, participating in discussions and this will help you as you come to your next assignments."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  Your formative assessment documented an exciting-looking trip, and hopefully the feedback you received on that will help you with the next assessment. You also had excellent attendance, which means that you are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Pink,"Luca has an excellent record of attendance. His participation in class has improved ever since the last RPAG report, which denotes that he is a conscientious student and able to improve on feedback. 
Nonetheless, his Formative 1 assessment was not good I am afraid and it portrayed issues with written communication. While Luca will probably manage to pass, he needs to continue working hard in order to try and progress to RH as well. 
I would also advise that he seeks AES support in relation to academic writing."
Pink,
Green,
Amber,
Pink,
Pink,"Luka’s seminar score needs significant improvement as his summative academic seminar mark is currently below the required 40% for speaking. Serious improvements need to be made if Luka is planning to pass AES and progress to his chosen course. The student needs to work hard in order to achieve the required progression mark of 70% in Writing. His listening skills need further development too as he scored below 40% in both mock exams. Therefore, Luka should continue to work on improving his academic skills throughout term 3 with the use of Mock Exams as well as independent study tasks available on the AES Online platform every week."
Green,"You are working well in Literature, meaning that you are producing excellent assignments - well done. However, in class you remain very quiet indeed and this is something it would be good to see you develop as you undoubtedly have contributions you could make to group and class discussions, but these are currently going unsaid. This is something for you to focus on as we move onto the all-important Term 3. However, you have done some very good work this term, so well done."
Amber,"This term had some difficulties for you, starting with a disappointing S1 grade. However, you bounced back well from this with better resit grade, so well done for that. You have shown signs of working very hard to catch up and to keep improving, although in class participation there is still room for improvement. I now recommend you use the break to plan and prepare for your S2 portfolio. With motivation and focus, you can use this time you have to really achieve a strong S2 grade."
Amber,"This term has been somewhat difficult for you, but you have shown a lot of hard work and motivation in order to bounce back from a disappointing summative grade. This paid off in a much better formative 2 grade, and should give you a lot of motivation moving towards the final summative. Keep working hard in terms of doing the homework every week, taking notes during every lecture, and revising them, in order to keep on top of the material that will really help you when writing the final summative. In class, however, you are generally reserved even though you are clearly capable of making excellent contributions. It would be nice to see you become a bit more confident in speaking up in class. However, overall, your effort this term under the circumstances has been really good, well done."

Given the high entry requirements from RHUL for arts, her listening, speaking and writing skills, however, need further development. Furthermore, she needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on the AES platform are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"You are clearly trying hard in Literature and you have started off the year with a good assignment mark, though there is room for improvement. We will discuss what you can do in order to improve for your summative at your tutorial. It is excellent that you make efforts to contribute in the class environment - well done: this is a good way to improve your work. You are, however, more reticent in groups. Try to change this as it will help you in the longer term."
Amber,"You have made a good start in Music. You are clearly working hard and you make an effort to contribute in class to discussions which is good to see. This has come together in your assignment mark which is undoubtedly a solid start. We can discuss strategies for improving your work for your summative in your tutorial so that you have a firmer foundation for next time. However, there are clear signs of progress in your work and you are doing well: carry on trying, participating and asking questions."
Pink,"Victoria has attended the majority of classes. She does not participate that much in class however, and does so only when prompted. I believe she needs to improve on her effort, motivation and determination if she is to pass and progress. She needs to focus more and work harder towards accomplishing them. Her assessment was bad as she failed to portray any kind of appropriate knowledge and understanding.  
I believe that she needs to attend the Sociology workshops and up her motivation and determination."

Green,"You have worked exceptionally hard in Literature and have the results to prove it. Your commitment to the workshops has meant that you have really transformed in class - and now make meaningful and apposite contributions to class discussions. Moreover, this transformation is also visible in your assignments, each of which is better than the last. If you carry on working hard like this, you are in a very good place for your summative work next term. Overall, you should be very pleased."
Green,"You have worked very hard in Music to improve your work and this has paid off, both in Summative 1 and Formative 2, now putting you on track to progress - well done. Your contributions in class are now more frequent and apposite, showing how hard you have worked and the effect that this has had on your work. The quality of your work has also noticeably improved. All in all, you should be very pleased with what you have achieved in Music over the past term."
Green,"This term began with a disappointing summative grade but since then you have worked very hard indeed to catch up, and your efforts and motivation have been rewarded with much better grades. In class, there has also been improvement in your engagement, and your contributions are typically valid and valuable. Class engagement is, however, something you could get even better at, with just a bit more confidence. Overall though, well done for all your hard work this term and please keep it up."
Amber,"The learning attitude and progress being made in AES course by Victoria was impressive. She tends to be participating actively in lesson discussions and she shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Her writing skills, however, needs further development as she has scored below 70% in her writing assessment to date, which is below the writing requirement for her chosen degree. Attending writing workshops and doing independent study using resources available to her on the AES Online and Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression."

However, he has scored below the 60% requirement for the IFY course overall in his listening, reading and writing assessment to date. Given the high entry requirements from RHUL, he needs to improve his listening, reading and writing skills. Attending listening and writing workshops is recommended. Doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to him on the AES platform is likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,"After a slow start Tariq achieved a commendable 92% in the formative 1 assessment.  Whilst this is an excellent result, Tariq must ensure homework is completed each week and submitted in a timely manner."
Amber,"Tariq is very knowledgeable in Physics, however his language of Physics can let him down at times. He is rapidly improving on this and taking action to improve his performance. He would benefit from engaging with the electronic resources I provided and guided to do well in the first summative. Also, additional help on EAL would benefit him. I am confident that he will pass the module and progress with no difficulties. As he is new to the country, he is finding his feet to the new way of life and new way of learning and interacting. He is finding this a challenge but is improving on this. He would certainly benefit from managing his time effectively during his studies and prioritise  and use his time effectively. I wish him well."

I also advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,"Tariq has achieved well in some concepts of maths but had difficulty with probability and probability distributions.  He also needs to ensure he gives full answers and not lose marks for not including every step and showing his method.

Tariq is clear on the topic he is researching for summative 2, but he must remember to take the steps to the final presentation and be timely in presenting these."
Amber,"Your attendance is for physics is good. You need to email me before the class if you cannot attend a session with your valid reason. Your participation in class discussion and solving the questions and sending your answers is not high enough. I expect you to be more active in the class, solve the questions and discuss your answers. Your F2 is 38% which needs improvement. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle."
Amber,"Your attendance for pure maths is very good but your sometimes participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by your tutor. Your S1-resit is 78% which shows a great improvement. Well done! However, your F2 is 57% which shows you need more revisions for S2. . I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for S2. Also you need to attend maths workshops to be ready for the S2."
Green,"Tariq is a hard-working and conscientious student. He listens carefully in class and focuses well when working independently or as a group. He is also fully engaged in class and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. Tariq has achieved well above 60% in both overall grades and in writing, which is above both the overall English language requirement and the sub-requirement in writing for his chosen degree. I am sure he will keep up the good work and do well in the upcoming summative assessments."

She has achieved above 60% in her formative listening and writing exams, which is an excellent result for this term. However, she needs to improve her reading skills. Doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to her on the AES platform is likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Serena is a good student who has been improving since the beginning of term. She is very engaged in class and appears to be very focussed and organised in her studies. She is able to answer questions well and contributes very well to class discussions.

Her formative result was good and I am confident that this will improve as she develops over the course of the year."
Green,"Serena - You are a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest in the class and demonstrate a sound command of the subject. You have strong potential to progress, and this is most clearly evidenced by your recent formative assessment score (63%).  Your performance on paper is good so far, but you do need to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. Improve this by completing all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your success."
Amber,"Serena has attended most of our classes. She is not very talkative during class and this is something she can improve on. Her formative assignment was good, but she needs to improve in order to attain a progression mark.This is connected also with her motivation and determination during the course.

Attending writing workshops and doing independent study over the Easter break using resources available to her on the AES Online and Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression. She is also advised to hand all of her homework in on time and to a high standard."
Green,"Serena is a very good student who continues to improve and develop her confidence as the course progresses. She is very motivated in class and participates well in class discussions and activities. Her summative 1 mark was in line with my expectations although I am hopeful that she will continue to develop and improve going forward. 

As long as Serena maintains her levels of engagement I am very optimistic about her success this year."
Green,"Serena - You're a bubbly and lively person and I enjoy having you in my class. You demonstrate a sound knowledge of the subject and significant interest in Economics. Your recent summative assessment score was 71% which was great, but I feel you have the potential to do even better. To prepare yourself and progress further, I advise you to answer the forum questions on time and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your progression."
Amber,"The term in sociology has had some challenges for you, with many assessments and resits. I feel you may have struggled with this workload, as your assessments have seemed quite rushed unfortunately. I really hope you can use the Easter break to recharge your batteries, revise the material, and begin planning/working on the final summative. With extra time to prepare, I really believe you have the ability to write a stronger essay. In class, however, your engagement has been very good and that is good to see. One important point would be to encourage you to keep taking notes during lectures/seminars in order to learn more actively rather than passively. Overall, you can be pleased with your efforts, and please remain motivated for the rest of the module as you can definitely keep doing better."
Green,"Serena is a hard-working and conscientious student. She listens carefully in class and focuses well when working independently or as a group. She is also fully engaged in class and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. Serena has achieved above 60% in both overall grades and in writing, which is above both the overall English language requirement and the sub-requirement in writing for her chosen degree.

However, she should try to participate more in whole-class discussions.  It is obvious that she puts considerable effort into her studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. Melody has met the majority of deadlines set but could be more consistent. Her results in assessments have generally been good but listening and writing are potential areas for further improvement."
Green,"Melody is a very good student. She is very focussed in class, concentrates well and takes notes. I would like Melody to get more involved in class discussions as this would develop her capabilities even further. 

Her formative result is reflective of her hard work and commitment and I am very confident about her ability to succeed on this course overall."

Green,"73 in S1, but -10% due to lateness and 77% in F2. This is a dilligent student who needs to ensure she keeps working hard and engaging. She is a bit quiet during lessons so should try to participate more in group work tasks."
Amber,"You are a good student. However, your concentration level in the class is lower than before. It is evident from your recent summative assessment score which is good (at 65%) but could have been higher as you are a strong student with good potential. Moving forward, please complete all the asynchronous activities on Moodle; memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook; and engage in independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook."

Green,"Kuo-Yu has a good understanding of financial accounting and is on track to progressing. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."

Green,Kuo-Yu is a talented student who clearly enjoys his studies. He participates well in class discussions and demonstrates very good understanding of the topics in lectures. I expect Kuo-Yu to do very well this year and overall in his studies. I suggest that he keeps doing what he is doing for the rest of the year.

Green,"I am pleased with the progress made by Yimu so far this term. He demonstrates good listening, reading and speaking skills. He has achieved above 60% English language requirement for IY1 programme in his listening and reading assessment to date, which is an excellent result for this term. I am sure he will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. He would also benefit from completing all of the homework on the AES platform on time. It is also imperative he attends all his AES classes."
Green,Attendance and engagement for both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be good but there is still room for improvement in your contributions during seminars.
Pink,Yimu is a quiet student who has not made an impact on the classes. He does not contribute to class discussions and finds it difficult to answer questions when challenged. Unfortunately Yimu did not submit a formative assignment and this gives some cause for concern about his progress. I am concerned that his standard of English may not be sufficient to successfully complete the course. Yimu needs to consider his motivation to complete the course and increase his energy if he is to be successful this year.
Green,"Good attendance and engagement during synchronous activities. However, you need to pay attention to the feedback for your Management First Formative Assessment to improve on your summatives."
Green,You commit to achieving your best in Quantitative Methods.

Amber,"The attitude and progress being made in AES course by Yimu were not impressive. He tends not to be participating actively in lesson discussions, when present, although he shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. He is advised to complete the asynchronous tasks on AES Online on time and to a high standard. Attending coursework and writing workshops is recommended to achieve the language requirement for his chosen degree."
Green,"Your attendance, class and moodle engagement have been good. You need to make good use of the resources provided in moodle to help you to prepare for your assessments. Additionally, ensure you are stretching yourself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Yimu is working at a good pace and shows a good level of understanding of the topics. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, you need to carefully consider the feedback from your summatives to improve on your writing, analytical and evaluation skills for the modules in semester 2."
Green,Good performance in this module. Keep it up.
Amber,Yimu is a very quiet student and although he is making steady progress I have some concerns that he needs to participate more in class activities. When asked questions he is unable to answer and this indicates that he may need to develop his understanding further. My suggestion is that he should spend time following up with moodle materials and reading the text book.
Green,"Good attendance, moodle and class engagement in this module so far. Keep up with this and make good use of the materials available on moodle to help with your preparation for your assessments."
Green,"There was a dip in your score between summative 1 and summative 2 but you did well. Please ensure that in semester 2, your summative 2 assessments show an improved score instead of a lower one."

Green,Attendance and engagement for both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be good but there is still room for improvement in your contributions during seminars.
Pink,Yushi is a quiet student who has made very little impact on the class. She does not volunteer to participate in group discussions and when challenged she finds it hard to answer. Yushi needs to develop her understanding by increasing her energy and commitment to her studies. If she needs help then she needs to ask for more support as this is readily available.
Green,"Good attendance and engagement during synchronous activities. However, you need to pay attention to the feedback for your Management First Formative Assessment to improve on your summatives."

Green,"Your attendance, class and moodle engagement have been good.  To help with your studies in this module, a lot of resources have been provided in moodle. Make good use of these as you prepare for your assessments."
Amber,"Zheng works well and just needs to put in some more effort to ensure progression. My advice to her would be to work on ensuring she is also working hard outside of class to ensure she is stretched and extending her knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Zheng from amber to green."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, you need to carefully consider the feedback from your summatives to improve on your writing, analytical and evaluation skills for the modules in semester 2."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, there is more room for improvement so work towards higher grades in the second semester."
Amber,Yushi is a quiet student who has been making steady progress.  She does not normally participate in class discussions or exercises and I would like to see this change as this will make a big difference to her development and progress overall.
Amber,"Your attendance and contribution in class have been commendable. However, you need to improve on your moodle engagement because that is where the learning materials for this module can be found."
Green,Very good performance in this module. A good demonstration of quantitative and probelm-solving skills.

Green,"I am generally happy with your progress in this module and so I am changing your feedback color to green. Good attendance record. Active during the class and workshops, and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Your marks for summative assessments 1 and  2 are also satisfactory and shows that you have been working hard. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to do more practice by solving different examples. Try to complete all exercises in our slides which will help you to do even better in your next assessment."
Green,I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Active during the class and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Your mark for summative assessments 1 is also satisfactory. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to be even more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I also recommend you to practice maths by solving multiple examples and exercises from the slides and the textbook.
Green,"YIP has been a very well engaged student and an active participant in lectures. He confidently asks questions, shares his ideas and seeks help about his work. Extremely hardworking!"
Green,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

He has been a very good member of the cohort and just needs one final push in his CW3 essay to get over the line."
Green,Shing is an excellent student. He puts in a very good level of effort in producing his work. His attendance has been really good. He also managed to score 86% in SA1. He needs to work on his participation in the class activities. If he stays consistent then should be able to complete this course successfully.
Green,"You have made good progress. You participate well in the lessons, well done!!
You will progress faster by spending more time studying, including going over the materials on Moodle, revising what you have learnt, working on the exercises and practise coding with Java. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."
Green,"You have made good progress and your responses to questions in live sessions show a good and increasing understanding of the topics, well done!! 


You will progress faster by spending more time studying, including going over the materials on Moodle, revising what you have learnt, working on the exercises and practise coding using Python. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly.

Keep up the good work!!"
Green,Well so far in the module. You have demonstrated a good level of engagement with class activities and your first summative assessment indicates progress in the module. Please make every effort to attend all remaining sessions and engage with the class activities. I like to hear more from you in group conversations and Padlet summaries. Keep up the hard work and aim to complete the recommended reading tasks from the textbook to maintain your level of performance.

Pink,Your strength appears to be speaking in the seminar sessions. You have shown a strong ability to explain and organise your ideas.  You need to be more consistent in your completion of the activities on the AES platform. This is where you can build a strong understanding of AES skills and you can then ask questions during the live sessions. You completed most exams in the middle of term. Your listening exam results were quite weak. I recommend you join a listening workshop next term to help build up this skill.
Green,"You have made a good start in the Literature module, showing that you think carefully about the materials given you and that you are engaged with the course. Your assignment also showed that you have been able to apply what you have learnt. In class, you are a ready participant in small groups, and are sometimes vocal in larger discussions, though this is somewhat rarer. It would be good to see you try and speak up a bit more on this occasions. In order to carry on being successful, you need to carry on working hard, engaging with the materials - and keep talking."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  Your formative assessment was a good first attempt, and hopefully the feedback will be useful when it comes to the next assessment. You also had excellent attendance, which means that you are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Amber,"Shawn has an excellent record of attendance. He also contributes in class whenever he is asked to do so. He is a conscientious student and his questions and comments are reflected in this. At the same time however, his assessment was not that good, primarily because of plagiarism in his paper. 
I would advise him to attend some AES workshops in relation to referencing and synthesising an argument using sources."
Pink,
Green,
Amber,
Pink,
Pink,"Shawn achieved a score of 64% in the last AES writing mock exam, which brings him closer to achieving the required progression mark of 70% in Writing. However, his listening skills as well as reading skills need further development as he scored below 40% in both mock exams. Therefore, Shawn should continue to work on improving his writing, listening and reading skills throughout term 3 with the use of Mock Exams as well as independent study tasks available on the AES Online platform every week."
Green,"You have been working hard in Literature this term, as evidence by your assignment marks, both of which were strong. We will discuss strategies, both in your tutorial and in class, for building on your Formative 2 so that you have the best chance of success in your Summative 2. However, your contributions in class discussions are few and far between and this is a shame as you undoubtedly have plenty to say, but are rather reserved. This is something for you to work on as we move into the new term. Meanwhile, well done on a good term's work!"
Amber,"This term has had some challenges for you. In general, in class, you can at times be passive in your engagement and participation, which is a pity because when you do speak your contributions are valuable. You have, however, done well to improve on your S1 score with the resit and you can hopefully now use the break to focus on preparing and planning your final S2 portfolio. With hard work and motivation, you can certainly still achieve a very good S2 grade."
Amber,"This term has been somewhat difficult for you, but you have shown effort and motivation in order to bounce back from a disappointing summative grade. The signs were there in the formative that you have learnt how to rectify your earlier mistakes. This has been promising to see, and with a bit more focus on sociological perspectives, I am sure you can do even better. In order to achieve this, I encourage you to keep remaining focused as much as you can, both in terms of making notes & doing homework each week, as well as during class. At times, during class you do need to be heavily coaxed into contributing and too easily claim that you're not sure what to say. Actually, you perfectly have the ability to make excellent contributions during class, so please keep pushing yourself to do so as this is a valuable way for you to keep learning too."

Green,"Vladimir`s results in assessments have generally been good however listening and writing are potential areas for further improvement. He can practise these skills doing the activities on Insendi. Vladimir has shown his potential and worked well at times however he should show more determination to do better in his studies.  Overall, he is making good progress. He has shown a good knowledge of the topics since the beginning of the term, which could yet be further broadened by practising his listening and writing."
Amber,"Vladimir is a polite and intelligent student, but he is often quiet in class and does not contribute to class discussions. When he is asked a question in class he is often unable to answer and this makes me think that he is having difficulty concentrating on the topic. When he is able to answer questions then he normally has good understanding and insight so it appears that he is capable of doing well on the course, but must apply himself with more energy if he is to improve his marks going forward."
Green,"96% in F1, well done! Please pay more attention in class and be more engaged. Review factorisation and always check your working for errors."
Pink,"Vladimir – Although you show some interest in class you need to make more of an effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussions that take place in breakout rooms. Your attendance is patchy and you have reported encountering technical difficulties on more than one occasion. Try to resolve your technical issues online before term 2. It is also disappointing that you did not submit your formative 1 assessment on time. This shows you clearly need to improve your engagement and work. To improve you need to concentrate and complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. Term 2 is an important term as things will get faster and more work will be expected. You must come back with a determination to do better."
Amber,
Amber,

Pink,
Amber,"Vladmir has attended most of the classes. During the live sessions he demonstrates that he has good ideas, which he usually expresses in group works. However, he should try to participate more in whole class discussions.  It is obvious that he puts considerable effort into his studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. Melody has met the majority of deadlines he could be more consistent with his work. Listening and writing are potential areas for further improvement."
Amber,"Vladimir has good potential to succeed on the course, but I am concerned that his generally low levels of energy and engagement may damage his opportunity to succeed going forward. His summative 1 score was 55 and he did not submit a resit. I have discussed this with him and he recognises the need to apply himself more consistently to his studies. His attendance is generally good, but he now needs to energise himself if he is going to succeed."
Amber,"75% in F2, 52% in S1. This student did really well in F1 (96%) but struggled with time management and motivation for S1. He needs to ensure for the future that he has a complete set of notes to use to revise, that he starts to revise well in advance and that he is able to keep up his engagement and motivation levels throughout the next term."
Pink,"Vladimir - I am confident that you follow the material covered in class closely, but you are not proactive in class discussions and don't make much effort in breakout rooms either. It is disappointing to see this not changing much despite your regular attendance of workshop, and even more disappointing that you submitted your assessment late. You have to work much harder and participate in class more to stand a chance of progressing from the foundation year. My advice would also be for you to complete all asynchronous activities on Moodle as this will speed up your success."

Pink,"Jonas demonstrates a good learning attitude and homework completion rate. His listening, reading and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below 45% in his listening, writing and reading assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, participating more in class, doing extensive listening exercises and using independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Jonas achieved a respectable 64% in formative 1.  The language of Decision Maths has not been easy for Jonas, and he must attempt to remember the associated names and phrases.  However, whilst not speaking very much in class sessions, Jonas does engage with the written activities and if he continues to solve problems and engages more in discussing the concepts, he will find it easier to remember the correct algorithm or term."
Amber,"A very quiet student, however very knowledgeable in Physics concepts. He has language barriers as his English Knowledge and application is very limited. I am aware he is using IT tools to translate and respond to my questions. Having said this, he is a joy to teach as he would be one of the first to put answers to calculation-based questions online chat. He would definitely benefit from 1:1 intervention and EAL support. With this he will have no difficulty in passing the module and progress to the next stages. I wish him well."
Green,"You try well. You will progress faster by doing more studying out of class, including going over the materials on Moodle, finishing exercises that are set. So, my advice would be to do more practice and be more active in class and confidently ask questions, share your ideas and seek help about your work to cover topics."
Pink,
Green,
Amber,
Green,
Pink,"Jonas tends to be focused on the content in class and shows a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. However, his overall grades are below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. He is advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. Attending writing workshops is still recommended. Attending listening workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of his progression."
Green,"Jonas had a slow start struggling with the language of Decision Maths, but he has learned the maths concepts well and demonstrated this in his excellent grade in summative 1.  

However, Jonas still finds it difficult to express the language of maths and will need to practise speaking in English about a mathematical concept before he attempts summative 2.

Well done, Jonas, for the achievement you have demonstrated so far."
Amber,"Your attendance for physics is very good. You always participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by the tutor. So it was a surprise for me that your F2 is 19%. We need to have a discussion about what has possible gone wrong and how we can prevent it to happen in the future. Based on your work, I am sure you could achieve higher grades. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle."
Amber,"Your attendance for pure maths is very good. You always participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by the tutor. Your S1-resit is 86%, which shows a great improvement. Well done! However, your F2 is 38% which shows you need to work harder for your S2. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for S2. Also, you need to attend maths workshops to be ready for the S2."
Amber,"Yiming shows good learning attitudes and contributes to class discussions. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. His listening and writing skills, however, need further development. I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops and drop-in sessions, doing extensive listening and writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."

Green,Makiya is a very good student who is very enthusiastic about her studies. She always offers her viewpoint in class discussions and will ask questions confidently if needed. Her formative result was good and I think as the year progresses Makiya will develop further. As long as Makiya maintains her positive mental attitude I expect her to do very well in her academic career.

Attending listening and writing workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Chattakan has a good attitude in class and is often the one supplementing his group by making the PowerPoint or taking notes. Chattakan, however, got a barely passing mark in his formative assessment. He needs to work harder on presenting his work in a way that shows-off his understanding of the subject and learn to ask for help when he needs it."
Amber,"Chattakan is quite responsive and enthusiastic in this module. He has developed very good research skills and aims for good resources when doing his research. This was the point that got him lower marks in his formative, but he has now improved and is on the road for making his skills even better for the upcoming summative assessments."
Amber,"Chattakan is an enthusiastic participator in class and works hard at self-reflection. Chattakan needs to expand his research horizons and start developing skills, in accordance with the module. I believe if he spends more time on looking at the module's Moodle resources, he will be able to improve his work quality."

Pink,"Xinyi demonstrates a good learning attitude and homework completion. Her listening skills, however, need further development as she has scored 10% in her listening assessment to date. Furthermore, she needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops and doing extra homework e.g. using the independent learning materials on the AES platform are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Xinyi is an insightful and assertive student who is engaging well in class. Xinyi needs to build her confidence as often she has brilliant ideas but hesitates in speaking up in class. Xinyi received a barely passing mark in her formative assessment, so needs to make sure that she follows the feedback provided and works hard on the summative assessment."
Amber,"Xinyi often comes up with perspectives that no one else has thought of, which makes her work very unique. However, Xinyi needs to focus on the questions being asked and try to relate the theory to the organisation being studied in order to achieve results that better than what she got in formative assessment."
Amber,"Xinyi understand and responds well to the material in class, but tends to be very quiet in discussions (unless asked specifically). I think Xinyi needs to be more assertive and engaging in class, which will elevate her understanding of the module"
Green,Xinyi is also one of the mathematically gifted students in the class. She often provides step-by-step solutions and helps decipher word problems. Xinyi received a good grade in her formative assessment and she needs to continue working hard in this module.

Amber,"Xinyi shows good learning attitudes and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term, when present. She has made satisfactory progress so far this term. However, her reading and listening skills need further development. I advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. I also advise her to attend reading workshops, doing extensive listening exercises, and working on independent learning materials as they are likely to help improve her chances of progression."
Green,"Xinyi is an insightful and assertive student who is engaging well in class. Xinyi has exhibited a growth in confidence as compared to last semester, and does not hesitate in asking questions on unclear concepts. Xinyi can improve her quality of work and writing skills further by using reliable sources of information."
Green,"Xinyi is very hard-working, completes the work required and participates positively in seminars/workshops. Now, my advice would be for her to stretch herself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Xinyi often comes up with perspectives that no one else has thought of, which makes her work unique. Xinyi needs to work on her quality of information and sources, and make sure that her referencing skills are adequate so that she does not lose marks over them. Overall, Xinyi is on the path to achieve high grades."
Green,Xinyi is a very gifted students and contributes excessively in class. She often provides modern solutions and examples for the theories being discussed. Xinyi has the ability to achieve a high mark in this module if she continues with the same zest.

Pink,"Shang's first set of mock results do not reflect his true ability, in fact it seems as though he may have encountered some technical issues, or did not take the exam as seriously as he should have. I hope that the upcoming formative exams will show an improved performance. One area that he should work on is his engagement with the online English platform on which I would like him to complete the screens as instructed each week -- by doing so will help him better understand the specifics of academic English in more detail, as this will place him in good stead for his summative assessments."
Green,"Shang is one of the most active students in class. He often responds well and participates enthusiastically in class discussions. However, Shang can sometimes be distracted quite easily and needs to omit all distractions during class time. Shang performed moderately well in his formative assessment, and needs to continue with the hard work."
Green,"Shang is an active and participative student who enthusiastically contributes to the in-class discussion. Shang received a good mark for his formative assessment, and received feedback on he should improve the quality of his work in order to achieve an even higher mark."
Amber,"Shang is active in the class, as well as quite enthusiastic. Shang has the tendency to get distracted quite easily and, at times, struggles with topics such as self-reflection, self-evaluation, and skills development. I think with feedback Shang will be able to improve his rating."
Pink,"Shang is usually quite vocal in class and often contributes formulas and equations. However, Shang did not score a passing mark in his formative assessment (36%), which goes to show that Shang needs to pay more attention to word problems and practice solving word problems on his own, not just in a group setting."

This places him in a good position for his finals. I hope that Shang continues to maintain this level of performance as I am sure he will achieve progression. Two areas that he should focus on are his reading and writing as these are area which he can be further strengthened. Moving forward, Shang, should access the reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals."
Amber,"Shang is one of the most active students in class. He often responds well and participates enthusiastically in class discussions. However, Shang can sometimes be distracted quite easily and needs to omit all distractions during class time.

I hope that the upcoming formative exams will show an improved performance. An area that he should focus on and practise is his academic writing -- look at the feedback and model answers that have been provided in class to help understand the requirements for academic writing. Han Lin is a pleasure to have in class as he is an active participant and contributes well to class discussion/ activities."
Amber,"Han-Lin is a bright student who comes up with well-researched examples in class when discussing international organisations. He is, however, often distracted by other things on his screen and has often been caught out when he is not paying attention. He scored moderately well in his formative assessment but has the potential to do much better if he can get rid of any distractions, especially during class."
Pink,"Han-Lin a confident student in class, where he contributes well. He often has significant insights to offer. However, Han-Lin received a barely passing mark in his formative assessment as he narrated text from a website, which lowered the relevancy and quality of his work. Han-Lin was told of this in his tutorial and said that he would be working harder in the future. Han-Lin has the potential to achieve a significantly higher mark in this module."
Amber,"Han-Lin engages well in class, but is often quite easily distracted and can be seen to be busy in other things whilst in class. Han-Lin needs to be more attentive in class and put away all distractions. This should help undertsand the topic better as well not have the need to ask for the instructions again and again."

For now, I have awarded Hanlin an amber as I am hopeful and optimistic that he will reach progression if he focuses on strengthening these skills. So moving forward Hanlin should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals, and act upon the feedback given to him by his AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to his performance."
Green,Han-Lin is a bright student who comes up with well-researched examples in class when discussing digital enterprises. He is keen on getting feedback on his work and is open to suggestions of improvement. Han Lin has worked on his distraction issues and is much better in paying attention in class now.

Amber,"Yunyi demonstrates a good learning attitude and homework completion. She contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. However, she has scored below the 60% requirement for the IFY course overall in her listening, reading and writing assessment to date. Given the high entry requirements from RHUL for arts, she needs to improve her listening reading and writing skills. Attending listening and writing workshops is recommended. Doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to her on the AES platform is likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,"You work hard in Literature and the results of this have been plain to see: well done. You have participated in group work and in class work and you have reaped the rewards of that in your assignment which was a good foundation for the start of the year. Doubtless there are areas which can be improved, which we will discuss in your tutorial. In order to expand the scope of your knowledge of the texts we study you might like to look at the additional materials on Moodle, but overall you should be pleased."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  You made a good attempt at the formative assessment, and hopefully learned from the feedback, as well as learning about the technical limitations of submitting embedded videos in documents! You have also had excellent attendance, and you are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Pink,"Yunyi has attended most of the classes. She contributes in our discussions but does so primarily when prompted. She needs to increase her participation more. Also, I believe that she needs to improve on her motivation and determination to progress. Her Formative assignment had many issues. Apart from being late to submit, there were also issues with plagiarism with her paper.
I believe that Yunyi might need some assistance from AES in planning her work and synthesising and citing appropriate sources."
Amber,

Amber,"Yunyi works hard and is improving all the time. She needs to focus on her speaking and listening skills as we approach the end of the course, in order to achieve the results she needs for progression."
Green,"You have shown yourself to be a dedicated student in Literature this year. You have consistently worked hard, both in class discussions and in group discussions. Despite something of a hiccough with your Summative 1, your Summative 1 Resit more than compensated and your Formative 2 gives you a very good foundation from which to work for your final summative work. We will be discussing strategies for this in your tutorial and in class, and in order to be successful you should carry on working hard. Overall, you can be pleased with your work in Literature."
Green,"This has been a successful term for you in which you have shown considerable improvement. That has been reflected in your F2 and your much improved S1 resit score, so well done for this. I now hope you can use the break to really focus on planning and preparing the final S2 portfolio, in order to use that time to make it as good as possible. With the same level of hard work, motivation and creativity you have shown already this term, I am sure you can continue to achieve an even better S2 grade. Overall, you can be very proud of your efforts this term, so please keep it up."
Green,"This term began with a disappointing summative grade but since then you have worked very hard indeed to catch up, and your efforts and motivation have been rewarded with better grades. So well done for this.
 In class, your attendance and your engagement has always been good. You often ask very good questions and make valuable points, so please keep this up. Remember to take the Spring break as a chance to revise any material and activities in order to maintain your level of sociology knowledge for the final summative. Overall though, well done for all your hard work this term, you should be proud of your efforts."

However, she has scored below the 60% requirement for the IY1 course overall in her listening, reading and writing assessment to date. She needs to be more participating in class by asking helpful questions and contributing usefully to group work. Attending listening and writing workshops is recommended. Doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to her on the AES platform is likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Jingyan somewhat struggles in this module. She contributes to the class discussion when asked but would probably do well with volunteering information by herself. Jingyan needs to work on her confidence in class, which in turn will help her language skills as well as her communication skills. Jingyan did not do well in formative assessment, so she needs to work extra hard in her summative and make sure that she keeps her tutors advice and feedback in mind."
Amber,Jingyan is a good and enthusiastic student in this module. She works hard in class and answers any questions directed to her in great detail. Jingyan got a good mark in her formative assessment and she knows she has to work on improving the resources where she gets her information from.
Amber,"Jingyan is engaging in class and contributes well to all discussions. However, she needs to pay more attention to the instructions given in class in order to improve her work quality. I would advise that Jingyan engage more on Moodle and go through the pre-learning tasks and other material in detail in order better understand the context of each topic."
Pink,"Jingyan struggles with the module of Quantitative Methods and that is evident by her formative assessment score of 24%. Jingyan needs to look at the feedback given in her formative assessment and work on improving her performance. Jingyan may also want to identify which topics she is struggling in, so that she can receive guided help from the tutors."

Pink,"Jingyan tends to be focused on the content in class and shows a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. However, her overall grades are below the overall English language requirement for her chosen degree. She should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. She is advised to complete her AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. Attending reading and writing workshops is still recommended. Being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve the chances of her progression."
Pink,Jingyan is a quiet student who needs to work on creating a presence in class. Jingyan also should focus on bringing in reliable resources on the work that is being presented during seminars. Jingyan has the potential to achieve much more if she is more engaging and attentive in class.
Amber,"Jingyan is keeping up with things. With an extra push, should pass this module. She needs to ensure she fully understands the topics covered. To help her with this, she should be engaging in creating mind-maps of all the concepts and ideas being explored in class and use this as part of her revision. Practising calculations outside of class is also essential to secure higher grades and move from amber to green. I am happy to provide her with exercises and suggest she reaches out to me for tutorials where I can guide her better."
Amber,"Jingyan is a good and enthusiastic student in this module. She works well in a group during in-seminar activities and tasks. However, Jingyan needs to work on increasing her subject specific vocabulary and revising the lecture slides before coming to the seminar for a better understanding."
Pink,"Jingyan may struggle with assessments in the module of organisational studies as theory-heavy modules might be her weak point. Jingyan needs to look at the feedback given to her the summative assessments of international business (a theory-led module from last semester) and work on improving her performance. Jingyan may also want to identify which topics she is struggling in, so that she can receive guided help from the tutors."
Green,Good performance in this module. You struggled with summative 1 but worked hard and showed a great improvement in summative 2. Well done and continue to apply the quantitative and problem-solving skills acquired in semester 2 and beyond.

Green,Yuri works hard and is always willing to learn. There are some weaknesses in listening and speaking which I will provide extra support for as we go on.
Green,Attendance and engagement for both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be good but there is still room for improvement in your contributions during seminars.
Pink,"Yuri is a very quiet student who appears to be attentive in class. However, she does not contribute to class discussions and finds it difficult to answer when challenged directly. Her first formative showed some areas of concern around her understanding of the material covered. Yuri needs to increase her energy and commitment to the course and become more involved in the classes to improve her chance of success on this course."
Green,"You put in a lot of effort to express yourself during synchronous engagements and this is impressive. Attendance, class engagement and your attitude have continued to be good."
Green,You commit to achieving your best in Quantitative Methods.

Green,I think the thing which has pleased me most with Yuri is her growing confidence in speaking. She is learning to overcome her shyness and is making genuinely valuable contributions in seminars. This is to be applauded. Well done!
Green,"Your attitude towards your academic work in terms of attendance, class and moodle engagement have been very good.To help you to excel in this module, utilise the learning materials provided in moodle as you prepare for for assessments."
Amber,"Yuri needs to ensure the work is understood and completed as expected. My advice to her would be to work on ensuring she is also working hard outside of class to ensure she is stretched and extending her knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Yuri from amber to green."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, you need to carefully consider the feedback from your summatives to improve on your writing, analytical and evaluation skills for the modules in semester 2."
Green,Good performance in this module. Keep it up.
Amber,"Yuri is a very quiet student who rarely participates in class discussions. However, she seems serious about her studies and produces good quality work. In order to succeed this year Yuri needs to maintain focus and engage in classes as much as possible."
Amber,"Though you have attended most lectures and engaged on moodle, your attendance to seminars have not been the best and you need to improve on this because during seminars, topics treated during the lecture are discussed further with practical examples in a smaller class size. Thus you have the opportunity to seek clarification on any difficult areas."
Green,Good performance in this module. You struggled with summative 1 but worked hard and showed a great improvement in summative 2. Well done and continue to apply the quantitative and problem-solving skills acquired in semester 2 and beyond.

Green,Mike has performed well this semester in all aspects of the course and is clearly working hard to improve in areas of weakness.
Green,Attendance and engagement for both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be good but there is still room for improvement in your contributions during seminars.
Pink,"Mike is a quiet student who does not participate fully in class discussions. He is unable to answer questions when directly challenged and I have some concerns about his progress. However, his formative 1 result was good and this gives some hope that he is understanding the material. Mike should re-energise himself for next term and commit greater energy to the classes to get the most out of the course."
Green,"Good attendance and engagement during synchronous activities. However, you need to pay attention to the feedback for your Management First Formative Assessment to improve on your summatives."
Green,You commit to achieving your best in Quantitative Methods.

Green,Mike has done very well recently and has taken on board all the work we have done in AES. There have been great improvements in the structure of his writing and I expect even better scores in the second iteration of the exams.
Green,"Your attendance, class and moodle engagement have been good. A lot of learning materials have been provided in moodle. Continue to make good use of them as you prepare for your assessments."
Green,"Mike is a hard-working student, and he gets involved in seminars and workshops. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,Good performance in this module. Keep it up.
Green,Good performance in this module. Keep it up.
Amber,"Yuchen is a good student, but is very quiet in class. It is difficult to tell if he is following the topics. However, he has produced some good work and as a result is making good progress. If he wants to make the most of the time at Royal Holloway I recommend that he gets much more involved in the class activities as this will not only increase his enjoyment, but improve his performance going forward."
Green,"Good attendance, moodle and class engagement in this module so far. Your attendance has been particularly commendable. Keep up with this and make good use of the materials available on moodle to help with your preparation for your assessments."
Green,Excellent performance. You consistently worked hard in this module. Keep this attitude up in semester 2.

Green,Kaan is able but sometimes appears to lack motivation. His writing needs attention and I would recommend some revision of intermediate level grammar to improve this.
Green,Attendance and engagement for both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be good. Continue to focus on your academics and work towards improving your summative assessments by implementing the feedback given for your formative assessment.
Pink,"Berke shows some promise, but he lacks organisation and focus to his studies. He did not submit a formative assignment and this is very concerning. He is able to take part in class discussions, but sometimes he demonstrates a lack of understanding of the topics being discussed. I suggest that Berke thinks about how to organise himself so that he can be more committed and focussed on classroom activities next term."
Green,Great improvement in your engagement since the last RPAG. Attendance has also  been good.
Green,There has been some progress but is still more room for improvement in your Quantitative Methods skills.
Green,

Amber,"Now is the time Berke really needs to focus on AES. He achieved very good scores in the listening, reading and speaking assessments, which tells me that he is more than capable of progression. However, he did not devote the required time and energy to the CW1 coursework, and it is now essential that he allow more time and focus more for both the resubmission of CW1 and your CW3 writing."
Amber,Kaan is an intelligent students with a lot to offer. He needs to work on engaging more during in-class discussions and give a well-researched opinion on the topics being discussed.
Amber,"Berke is a keen student. He makes a lot of effort with his work. My advice to him would be to work on ensuring he is also working hard outside of class to ensure he is stretched and extending his knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Berke from amber to green."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, you need to carefully consider the feedback from your summatives to improve on your writing, analytical and evaluation skills for the modules in semester 2."
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, there is more room for improvement so work towards higher grades in the second semester through class and moodle engagement."
Amber,Kaan is a good student who needs to work on being contributive in MMC seminars. This will help him with the upcoming summative assessments. Kaan should also make sure that he is reviewing all the material given on Moodle.
Amber,"Kaan is a regular student who often contributes information in class and does well in group activities. Kaan needs to work on elevating his confidence and asking for help if he is struggling with a certain topic in OS, as this will help him achieve high grades in the summative assessments."
Green,"Although you struggled a bit with this module, your hard work helped you to pass both summative 1 and 2. Continue to improve on your quantitative and problem-solving skills."

Amber,"Damian demonstrates a good learning attitude towards the AES course. He seems to understand well in class. However, he has scored below the 60% requirement for the IFY course overall in his listening assessment to date. Given the high entry requirements from RHUL, he needs to improve his listening and writing skills. Attending listening and writing workshops is recommended. Doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to him on the AES platform is likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Hyeongpyo is a good student who is attentive in class and shows focus on his studies.
He contributes to class discussions (albeit with some prompting) and he is able to answer questions when asked. However, at times his level of understanding is lacking. I suggest that if he does not understand something he should ask more questions during class.
His formative result was a little disappointing, but I think that if he continues to work hard and considers the feedback he is likely to succeed on this course."
Amber,"You are show some engagement in class, and this is good. You also demonstrate a sound command of the subject and this is clear from your most recent formative assessment score, which was 58%. You do need to put in more effort though, in order to succeed and you do need to stretch yourself further. Improve your performance by following all the asynchronous actives on Moodle and memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. This should help you improve your scores further."
Green,"Damien's attendance record has been excellent. While he contributes in class only when prompted, when he does so his contributions are always successful and accurate. He is a conscientious student, which is reflected also in the result of his assessment."
Pink,
Amber,
Amber,
Green,
Pink,"Damian tends to be focused on the content in class and shows a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. However, his overall grades are below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree as he missed the listening and writing mock exams. He should work hard to keep up with the progression requirements. He is advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. Attending writing workshops is still recommended. Attending listening workshops, being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of his progression."
Amber,"Hyeongpyo is a generally very positive student. Whilst he does not often ask questions, when asked, he is able to address questions competently and engage in class discussion. His summative 1 score was 62 and this places him as a borderline student who needs to make sure that he maintains his level of commitment and energy on his studies if he is going to be sure of progressing to his next year of study at Royal Holloway."
Amber,"You show some engagement in class, and this is good. You also demonstrate a good command of the subject, which is clear from your most recent summative assessment score, which was 67%. Keep working hard and aim to complete all the asynchronous activities on Moodle. Also, where possible, engage in some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook."
Green,"Overall, this has been a good term for you in terms of your assignment grades. Both your summative and formative grades have been good, although you have the ability to do even better. In terms of classwork, however, the picture is slightly different. Your engagement has been inconsistent. You have often had connection issues or technical difficulties and remained very quiet. This is an issue as it means you don't have the full possibility to regularly practice your learning during class; and it also removes my opportunity to see what progress you are making each week. Please work on improving this and resolving your connection/technical issues. Overall, though, your written assignments are very good so well done, and please remember that you can reach out to me if you ever have any questions."
Amber,"Damian shows good learning attitudes and actively contributes to all class discussions. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. His reading and writing skills, however, need further development. I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Attending reading and writing workshops and drop-in sessions, doing extensive reading and writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."

She has achieved above 60% English language requirement for IFY programme in her listening, reading and writing assessment to date, which is an excellent result for this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!"
Green,78% on F1. Good work! Please look at partial fractions and factor theorem again.
Green,"66% on F1. Very engaged. Interested in studying criminology in the future. Very bright and positive student. Keep working on developing your evaluation skills in essays and look at the F1 comments please. In future essays, please focus on using Harvard Referencing style, as well as structuring your essay very clearly."
Amber,"Amina's attendance record is excellent. She consistently participates and engages with the content during class and makes valuable contributions. Her formative assessment result was fair, but she is able to perform much better than this. She needs to consider her feedback and feedforward from the Formative assessment and work towards improving her mark. She is more than able to perform much better than this."

Green,"Amina demonstrates good English language skills and contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. She listens carefully in class and focusses well when working independently or as a group. She is also fully focused on the content and shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. Her writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops and doing extra homework from the Language Development section of the book is likely to improve chances of progression. She is also advised to complete her AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate."
Green,"78% in F1, 60% in F2, 78% in S1. This student needs to work on managing her time/stress levels so as to allow plenty of time for revision. Overall, Amina is diligent and hard-working and has shown strong class engagement."
Green,"75% in S1, well done. Very engaged student who enjoys reading additional psychology texts outside of class and discussing psychology. She has a good grasp of concepts and evaluation."
Pink,"This term has been difficult for you, due to health issues and this has affected your attendance and overall engagement in class. Your assessments have, unfortunately, repeatedly shown issues with plagiarism, even though I spoke to you about this and you attended the AES Workshop on plagiarism. I can only attribute your repeated issues with plagiarism to your feeling rushed and pressured to finish assessments on time. Please try to avoid this in future, and remember that you will have more time to prepare and work on your final summative. Try to catch up on the material, lectures slides and Moodle activities over the Easter break, and remember that you can also reach out to me if you have any questions. If you do this, I do feel you have the ability to achieve much better grades in the summative."
Green,"Amina listens carefully in class and focuses well when working independently or as a group, when present. She is also fully engaged in class and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. Amina has achieved above 60% in her overall grades, which is above both the overall English language requirement and the sub-requirement in writing for her chosen degree. I am sure she will keep up the good work and do well in the upcoming summative assessments."

It is obvious that she puts considerable effort into her studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. In addition, she can apply her knowledge under assessment conditions and in practical tasks quite well.  Her exam results are very good except for listening."
Green,"Your classwork has noticeably improved over the course of the term - well done. You are clearly engaging with the materials set and are working hard. Your assignment result is a clear result of this. In your tutorial, we will discuss how you can improve your work still further so that you can push your assignment mark up further. In group work you contribute a great deal, which is good to see. Overall, you have done a good term's work and there is plenty for you to build on next term."
Green,Bridgit has been an exceptionally conscientious and hard-working student. She has shown a lot of progress regarding the subject-specific knowledge and analytical skills and her grade for the Formative 1 reflects this. Her class contributions show excellent insight and an easiness to apply the conceptual and theoretical knowledge to new topics.
Green,"Bridgit has an excellent record of attendance. She seems to be a conscientious student and this is reflected in her participation in class and results in the Formative Assignment. Her assignment was very good. I have no worries over her progression, as long as she continues to do what she currently does."
Amber,
Amber,
Pink,
Amber,
Green,"Bridgit has attended most of the classes. She is usually an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions.   It is obvious that she puts considerable effort into her studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. Her knowledge of the topics is reflected in her performance in exams. Bridget also has a very good level of understanding, particularly in seminar discussion skills."
Green,"You have performed well in Literature. However, this is somewhat uneven: your Formative 2 was much stronger than your Summative 1, placing you in a very good position for your final assignment. In class, you work well in groups, but remain silent in class discussions, although this is something that we have discussed. All in all, it would be good to see your undoubted potential come together in your final assignment, which has every chance of happening if you carry on working hard."
Green,"Bridgit's submission for the Resit of the Summative Assessment 1 has shown a very good improvement. She worked hard to improve her writing, analytical and research skills which was reflected by the high grade in the Resit. Bridgit's engagement with this course has always been very good. She allocates time to produce high quality submissions for the homework and asynchronous activities. She has shown confidence and great insight during the class discussions. I particularly appreciate her ability to engage critically with new topics and the attention she pays to the readings. I recommend that she keeps up the good work."
Green,"Overall, this has been a good term for you, especially as you showed strong improvement from your initially disappointing summative to do much better in the resit, so well done for that. In terms of classwork, however, the picture is slightly different. Your engagement has been inconsistent. At times, especially during a debate exercise, you feel very able and confident to contribute which is great to see. At other times, you go quiet and do not contribute at all. It would be very good to see you improve in this regard, maybe by using the chat function if you feel you need more time to think. Overall, though, your written assignments are very good so well done, and please make good use of the break to prepare and practice for your final summative."

Your completion of activities on the AES platform has been variable. Try to complete more of the tasks regularly. You have good exam results from the middle of term, but you did not take the reading exam, so I am keen to see how you do in the week 10 exam. I have confidence you will continue to do well in this course next term."
Green,"You have made an excellent start in the Literature module, most clearly reflected in your assignment mark, which is richly deserved - well done. Your contributions to class discussion are generally very apposite, and you have a clear command of and interest in the subject. You also ask questions about the subject material, many of them highly pertinent - so well done. In order to carry on this excellent start, you should continue to read the texts, interrogating them and working hard."
Amber,"Desiree has made a good progress since the start of the term. Her grade for Formative 1, as well as the assignments and class contributions, reflect good subject-specfic knowledge and improved analytical skills. I would advise her to allocate more time for completing the homework - often the submissions appear rather rushed - and devote time regularly to reading the required chapter from the textbook."
Green,"Desiree's attendance record has been excellent. Her contributions in class are usually to the point and quite insightful. She is a conscientious student and this is reflected also in the result of her assessment, which was very good. If she continues with the same determination and engagement, she will have no issues with progressing."
Amber,
Green,
Pink,
Green,
Amber,"Desiree makes frequent contributions in class. However, her writing skills need further work and improvement as she scores below the required 70% in AES writing mock exams. Therefore, it is recommended that she does independent study using resources available on the AES Online platform, completes mock exams as set by her tutor and submits the compulsory AES tasks every week. If Desiree continues to work on her academic skills development in term 3, she should increase her chances of progression to her chosen UG course at RHUL."
Green,"You have worked hard in Literature this term: well done. You show that you are committed to the subject and engage with the class materials at a good level. Sometimes you lack focus in group work, so this is something to keep an eye on. Your assignments submitted this term have also been strong. We will discuss how you can build on your formative work for your final summative assignment in your tutorial. Meanwhile, carry on working hard as you are, and you have a good foundation for success."
Amber,"Desiree's submission for the Resit has shown a good improvement in terms of research skills and engagement with political science. She needs to devote more time to improve her knowledge and understanding of the topics discussed this term, as well as her to strengthen her analytical skills. Desiree has always completed her homework and asynchronous activities on time and on a few topics she has shown a great interest. I recommend that she uses the time during the spring break to catch up with the readings this term, to start revising for the Summative Assessment 2 and to practice essay writing."
Amber,"Overall you have had a good term, often contributing well in class, although there have been weeks where this was a bit more inconsistent. At times you have needed a little bit of coaxing to contribute but you have found the courage to always do so when prompted, and should take confidence from that. Your summative 1 grade was good, so well done for this. However, this is amber because you struggled a bit more with the formative 2, which was slightly rushed. The good news on that front is that you should have more weeks to plan and research for your final summative essay. So please keep working hard, stay on top of the weekly material by doing the homework and asking me any questions if anything is ever unclear. By doing this you will maintain the sociological foundations in terms of concepts and terms that will help you write a much better summative 2 essay. Well done on all your efforts this term and please keep it up."

Her reading and listening are skills that need to be strengthened over the duration of the course, and I believe that as long as she practices she will be able to achieve her progression requirements. In class activities she needs to be a more active participant and contribute to group discussion. She should keep working through the screens on the online English platform as instructed each week -- by doing so will help her better understand the specifics of academic English in more detail."
Green,You have a positive attitude and always ready to learn but you need to build a little more confidence through contributions during seminars without being pushed to do so.
Amber,"Sihan is a very quiet student, but appears to be working well. However, I have some concerns due to her lack of participation in class discussions and her inability to answer questions when asked. However, her formative result was good and I hope that my concerns are unfounded and she continues to make progress during the year."

Amber,"I am hopeful and optimistic that Sihan's will achieve progression in AES, despite having missed a number of classes due to health issues this semester that have prevented her from being participative in classes. Although she performed well in her speaking/ seminar exam, her exam results for her reading, writing and listening show that she needs to further focus on these areas in order to strengthen them. Moving forward, Sihan, should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help her prepare for her finals and take on the feedback given to her by her AES tutor."
Amber,Your attendance and moodle engagement have been good but you need to improve on your engagement in class as this will help you to improve on your English language skills and boost your confidence.
Green,"Sihan does the work expected of her and shows a good level of understanding. Now, my advice would be for her to stretch herself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Satisfactory performance in this module. However, you need to carefully consider the feedback from your summatives to improve on your writing, analytical and evaluation skills for the modules in semester 2."
Amber,
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, there is more room for improvement so work towards higher grades in the second semester."
Amber,"Sihan is a quiet student who does not normally participate in class discussions or ask questions. However, she has produced some good work last year so clearly has some talent. I would suggest that she increases her engagement with classes, for example by keeping her camera on for the entire class. I would also suggest greater engagement with class activities."
Green,"Your attendance, class and moodle engagement for this module have been good and it is exciting to note that your contribution during seminars have improved from the situation last semester. Keep up with this and utilise the learning materials available on moodle."
Green,Good performance. You were consistent in both summative 1 and summative 2. The quantitative and problem-solving skills acquired must be utilised in the semester 2 modules.

He achieved very good scores in all the assessments, which tells me that he is more than capable of progression. However, he did not devote the required time and energy to the CW1 coursework, and it is now essential that he focus more on the resubmission of CW1 in order to assure progression."
Green,"Your attendance, class and moodle engagement have been good. Many resources have been provided in moodle to help you to prepare for your assessments."
Green,"Jeffrey is a good student working really well and should be on track to progress. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."

Green,"Satisfactory performance in this module. However, there is more room for improvement so work towards higher grades in the second semester."
Amber,Jeffrey is a good student who concentrates well in class. Although he is a little quiet he is able to answer questions when challenged and he shows good understanding. In order to succeed jeffrey needs to maintain his focus and work steadily at the course including independent reading of the course book. If he continues to work hard then I am very hopeful of his success on this course.
Amber,"Your attendance and contribution in class have been commendable. However, you need to improve on your moodle engagement because that is where the learning materials for this module can be found."
Green,Very good and consistent performance in this module. Well done. Apply the quantitative skills acquired in your future academic pursuits.

His reading and writing are skills that need to be further strengthened over the duration of the course, and I believe that as long as he practises he will be able to achieve his progression requirements. He seemingly contributes well to group discussion and sometimes participates in wider class activities. A further area that he could work on is his engagement with the online English platform on which I would like him to complete the screens as instructed each week -- by doing so will help him better understand the specifics of academic English in more detail."
Green,Good engagement with both synchronous and asynchronous activities. Incorporate the feedback received for your formative assessment to improve on subsequent assessments.
Amber,"Shuaihua is a quiet student who appears to be making progress. He does not contribute to class discussions, but is able to answer when asked directly. His summative result was good, but I remain concerned that Shuahai needs to increase his participation to support his learning."

Unfortunately, his result for CW1 was unusually low, and I hope that he is intending to resubmit, otherwise he is at risk of not progressing to year 2. For now, I have awarded Shuaihua an amber as I am hopeful that he will reach progression. So moving forward Shuaihua should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help him prepare for his finals, and act upon the feedback given to him by his AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to his performance."
Green,"You have started this module on a good note as your attendance, class and moodle engagement have been good. Continue to make good use of the resources provided as you prepare for your assessments."
Green,"Shuaihua is a hard-working student and completes his work to a good standard. Now, my advice would be for Shuaihua to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,Your performance in this module has been good. Apply the skills you have acquired in semester 1 to improve on your grades for semester 2.
Amber,
Green,"Good performance in this module. However, there is more room for improvement so work towards higher grades in the second semester."
Amber,"Shuaihua has some potential to do well on the course, but he often lacks focus in class. He often turns his camera off and it appears that he is losing concentration during the lesson. However, he does seem motivated to succeed and if he can increase his focus he is very capable of having a successful year."
Green,"Your attendance, class and moodle engagement for this module have been good and it is exciting to note that your contribution during seminars have improved from the situation last semester. Keep up with this and utilise the learning materials available on moodle."
Green,"Good performance in this module and though you did not need to, you opted to resit QM 1 to improve your progression average."

Pink,"Anas joined the AES live session yesterday at 1-2pm, 17th February for the first time. Before that, I hadn't, I hadn't met him. So his RPAG rating might be inaccurate."

Green,
Amber,"Anas demonstrates good reading and speaking skills and sometimes contributes actively, when present, to class discussions. However, he needs to be more focused on the content in class and revise the concepts introduced so far so that he has a good understanding of them. His writing and listening skills also need further development. Attending writing workshops and doing independent listening activities using resources available to him on the AES Online is likely to improve chances of progression. He is also advised to complete all of his homework on time and to a high standard."
Green,"Anas has been active in class when he is present (attendance level at 80%) and he has engaged with group discussions, Padlet submissions and quick question-answer activities. 
He should make every effort to attend all remaining classes. This will help him to maintain his level of performance, ask any questions he may during the class and improve his technical English by engaging in discussions and answering questions."
Amber,"Anas has a good understanding of the subject. He participates actively in class activities. Although, he has to work on his attendance to become more consistent and be able to achieve better marks. He managed to score 65% in SA1 but has the potential to do better. Perhaps improving the attendance will be the key to achieve improved results."
Green,"Anas has been active in class when he is present and he has engaged with group discussions, Padlet submissions and quick question-answer activities. I am concerned with his attendance level which is very low (standing at 45%) at the moment. Although, he is doing well in his module, he should make every effort to attend all remaining classes."
Green,"Anas has been active in class and he has engaged with group discussions, Padlet submissions and quick question-answer activities. He is doing well in this module, and he should make every effort to attend all remaining classes. 
Keep up the hard work Anas."
Pink,"Anas tends to show a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term, when present. However, his overall grades are far below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He should work extra hard to keep up with the progression requirements. He is advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. I also advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will develop his critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops is recommended. Being more participating, doing extensive listening exercises, and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve the chances of his progression."
Amber,Anas has done well in the S1 (100%). He needs to make sure that his attendance is strong in this module as the assessments are taking place every second week. His attendance in semester 2 is patchy. He has missed 3 sessions out of 8 and was late to the sessions couple of times. He really needs to work on his attendance and punctuality.
Green,Well done. You have passed the module and met your progression requirements.
Green,Well done on successfully passing the module. Keep up the good work in the next semester.
Green,"Well done, you have made a good start to the module. You need to improve your attendance in class and engage with class activities. 
Please catch up with the material on Moodle, watch the recorded videos and practice with examples and exercises from class notes. 
If you have any questions, you can attend the workshop sessions or bring them to class to discuss them at the end of every session."
Green,"Well done, You have passed and met your progression requirements. You may wish to review and practice with examples and exercises from IY1_OOP I to improve your performance in IY1_OOP II."
Amber,"You seem to be making some progress on the module. I am concerned with your absents in the module and I have communicated this to you in a one-to-one short meeting. I am happy to hear from you that you were aware of the issue, and you were planning to attend all the remaining sessions."

Pink,"Jiashuo’s first set of mock exam results have shown that he needs to focus more on his English studies if he is to achieve progression. He did not take the listening exam and as a result this has affected his overall outcome. Although he passed his reading and writing, there is still a lot of room for improvement, and so for the coming summative exams, Jiashuo, should take advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help him prepare, and seek further support from his AES tutor."
Amber,"You have had a mixed term in the Literature module. You are incredibly quiet in class, so it is difficult to gauge how much you understand. This is true both in small groups and in larger class discussions, and is something you need to work on to ensure that you can work towards progression. However, your assignment was good, which was promising, so it is clear you have a firm foundation from which to work. I look forward to seeing improvements in the next term and we will discuss strategies when I see you for your tutorial."
Green,"Overall you have had a good term, but there is a mixed picture here. I am giving you a green because your formative grade was good, and as have been all your written homeworks. You are clearly a very able student and I believe you can even do better in your summative now that you have had more practice. However, during class, you have had serious difficulties either due to connection problems or because of your own shyness in coming forward to speak up during discussions. Contributing and being more active in discussion/asking questions would be an excellent skill for you to keep developing, especially for the rest of your academic studies. Remember, that the class is only a small and nice group and everyone is friends, so you should feel free to speak or ask anything at any time!"
Amber,"Jiashuo is a very quiet student who seems reluctant to contribute to class discussions. I would really wish to encourage Jiashuo to participate in discussions as this is a very good way to learn, both by responding and asking questions.

Jiashuo's writing demonstrates understanding, but he must focus on the organisation, structure and clarity of his writing, ensuring that he always responds to the question.

As is the case for the other students, Jiashuo needs to learn academic conventions, in particular referencing.

I hope that Jiashuo would feel able to ask for help if there was something was not clear to him."
Amber,"Jiashuo has performed well in his summative assessments and has achieved over 60% in all skills except his listening which is slightly under 60%. To help him prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help him improve. In addition, he should also focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve his end goal."
Pink,"You have rather mixed results in the Literature module: your Summative 1 was not good, but you are back on track after a very good Summative 1 Resit. However, your Formative 2 is nothing like as strong, so you need to take very careful note of the feedback given to you so you can improve there for your final assignment avoiding resits. Generally speaking you engage well with asynchronous work, but you could participate more in class to help you as we reach this final stage of the course."
Green,"You have worked well this term, and been regular in completing asynchronous activities. You also did really well for your Summative 1 which you can be pleased about.

One area for improvement remains classroom engagement. I do know you have had connection issues, and have tried to engage via the chat function. However, it would be even better if you could engage more in the class, so that I could be able to monitor how well you are understanding the concepts.

What I recommend now is that you keep on track for Summative 2 by revising the relevant topics and any weeks you missed due to health problems, and get started on making the video essay. Feel free to reach out to me if you need any extra help."
Amber,"You did very well in improving your S1 grade on the resit, so well done for that. Recently, health issues have made you fall slightly behind, so please make sure to manage your time well from now until the S2 deadline. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Green,"Maite has performed very well in her first set of mock exams, particularly in her reading, listening and speaking. I have no doubt that as long as she continues with her current performance she will do well in the upcoming summative exams. Her writing, already very good, is one area that can be further worked on, and one that I believe she can achieve an even higher score in providing she takes on board the feedback and applies it to her writing. I recommend completing 1 or 2 writing exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare and seek feedback from her AES tutor."
Amber,Maite is a very good student who shows good levels of engagement in class and contributes to class discussions well. She appears to be interested in the subject and this reflects on her good formative 1 result which is very close to the required standard. Maite has worked very well to overcome the logistical challenges that she has faced to attend the course. I am very optimistic about Maite's future as long as she can continue to maintain her energy and commitment.
Green,"You're a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest during class time and demonstrate a sound knowledge of the subject. Your recent summative assessment score is 68%. You have strong potential to increase your score further, as evidenced by your performance in your assessment. However, you need to answer forum questions on time and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your progression."
Amber,"Good student with interest in films and psychology (always provides useful examples of movies relating to the topic at hand. Her essay writing skills need work in terms of gaining understanding about how to evaluate the theories discussed. F1 =39% (summarised the concepts, no evaluation, did not understand the essay question) - more work is needed to improve for S1"
Green,"Maite possesses strong language skills which she has been able to apply well to the AES exams and coursework. Her results to date are very good to outstanding. She has demonstrated strong critical thinking skills and this will put her in good stead for her university studies. An area that could be improved upon further is her exam writing skills and providing she takes on the feedback I believe that Maite will be able to do well in the summative exam. I have recommended the reading and writing exam booklet as a resource that will best help her practice. In addition, she should focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result."
Amber,"Maite is a very good student who has a great deal of talent. She engages well in class and is often able to show very good understanding of topics through her answers to questions. She has worked very well to overcome her logistical challenges and this is impressive for a student. Her summative 1 result was very good and this is reflective of her very good understanding of the topic. Unfortunately, she has not submitted a formative for assignment 2 so this decreases the opportunity for developmental feedback. However, overall I remain confident about Maite's prospect of success this year."
Green,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance, but I can stress that having a green colour for the last RPAG means that you are doing well, so keep up the good work. I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to exceed and succeed."
Green,"S1 assignment was great, good job. F2 was 68%, well done.
 This student has worked hard to learn to write psychology essays. Also, this student is generally passionate about psychology."

Pink,"Ahmet's first set of mock exam results have not gone well and have shown his performance needing immediate attention, as he did not achieve a pass mark of 40% for reading and listening. For the coming summative exams he should take full advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help him prepare and seek further support from his AES tutor – by doing so, I believe he will be able to achieve progression."
Amber,Your attendance for applied maths is very good and you usually participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by the tutor and finish your homework. So it was a surprise for me that your F1 is 32%. We need to have a discussion about what has possible gone wrong and how we can prevent it to happen in the future and also how we can improve your grade for your F2 and S1 after the holidays. I also recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the Formative 2 and summative 1.
Pink,"Your attendance for physics is very good. You sometimes participates in the class discussions and solves the questions given by your tutor. I can clearly see that you try to finish your homework. It seems that sometimes you do not ask enough questions when you are not sure about a topic, so please ask for more explanations if you think that the topic is not 100% clear for you. Your F1 was 26% which shows we need to take several serious actions to improve it for the summative 1. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the summative 1. We will have a discussion after the holidays about some possible ways to improve your physics and ability to solve questions possibly including having some extra sessions."
Green,"Ahmet is a good student who tries to put in excellent effort into his studies. He tries to actively participate in class discussions and raises questions wherever he needs further support. My advice is that he needs to familiarise himself with the key terms being used in the lecture as he sometimes struggles with the language. Ahmet has the ability to understand various topics but sometimes does struggle, for that if he can take a proactive approach and go through the lecture notes before the timetabled session, it could help in understanding the topic better. He also needs to put in a good level of effort to prepare for the upcoming summative 1 assessment."
Pink,"Ahmet's summative exams have shown that a lot more work is needed in order to pass and meet progression. Thus, to help him prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help him reach progression as well as attending writing workshops. Furthermore, he should focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result. He should resubmit his CW1 to increase his chances of progression."
Amber,"You have attended all your applied maths classes and been always engaged with the lessons. You made a significant improvement in your summative 1 with 63%, and you only need 67% from your summative 2 in order to progress to the university this September. Therefore, I recommend you to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation and continue attending your applied maths classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Green,"You have attended all your physics classes since the beginning of the year and always tried to understand what has been taught in the class by asking questions. You made a significant improvement in your summative 1 resit (your provisional grade is 63%) and you only need 67% from your summative 2 assessment in order to be able to progress to the university in September. Therefore, I recommend you to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation and continue attending your physics classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Amber,"Ahmet has made improvements. He is consistent with his homework and class activities. However, he still needs to work harder to improve his overall score in this module. He recently scored 63% formative 2. If he takes advantage of workshops and extra tutorials, it will help in improving preparation for the upcoming summative 2."

Pink,"Neha is a conscientious student who participates well in class and group activities. Due to a change in family circumstances, Neha, has not been able to participate fully in her first set of formative exams, but judging by her listening and writing grades I believe that she will be able to achieve progression. Neha should take advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare, and seek further support from her AES tutor."
Green,"You have made an excellent start to the course - well done. Your formative assignment showed that you are a dedicated and capable student, who has worked hard over the course of the term. You work well in groups, which is good to see. However, it would be nice to hear more from you in class discussions as you undoubtedly have good points to make. All in all, you should be very pleased with your work in the Literature module."
Green,"Good engagement. Improvement from previously. Sometimes overthinks when answering questions in class so answers about the definition of the general words as opposed to the actual question in terms of relevance to the class. 78% in F1, very good work! Very interested in the topic and the essay was well written and used evaluation techniques."
Pink,"I wish that Neha would speak more in classes. She tends to remain very quiet and sometimes gives the impression of being a little disengaged. I do, however, understand that this may be because Neha is currently undertaking her studies under less than ideal circumstances.

Neha's writing demonstrates understanding, but she needs to focus on the structure, organisation and presentation of her written work. Neha also needs to ensure that she responds more directly to the questions in the brief.

As with all students, Neha needs to be come familiar with academic conventions, in particular the inclusion of sources in her writing and a reference list that is presented according to the Harvard system."
Amber,"Neha’s summative results are overall quite pleasing, however it is clear that her reading skills and CW1 are areas that need to see some significant improvement in order to meet progression. That said I am very positive that she will her overall shows that more time should be dedicated to her English studies if she is to achieve progression. Speaking and reading are her stronger skills, but failed to reach a pass mark for her writing exam. To help her prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help her to pass the exams. In addition, she should also focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve her end goal, and perhaps consider resubmitting her CW1 in the resit period."
Amber,"After an excellent Summative 1, your Formative 2 is nothing like as strong, though I know that you are aware of some reasons for that. Hopefully this is something you will be able to build on and improve on when we get to Summative 2 as you have shown yourself to be an engaged and committed student in the module. Your asynchronous work is generally well done. An area for you to think about improving is your participation in class, which is often sparse. However, there is work here for you to be pleased with and build on as we head into the final part of the course."
Green,"Good S1 essay. F2 grade was 69%, good job.
Well done. This student is diligent and hardworking and does well in assignments overall but needs to improve her attention in class and attendance."
Green,"Your Summative 1 result was excellent and your Formative 2 showed promise.
You have already started work on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing and puts you in a strong position. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Amber,"Rotana is a conscientious student who contributes well to class discussion and group activities. In coming weeks I would like to see her better engaging with the on-line English platform and submitting her homework. It will enable me to both monitor her progress and provide appropriate feedback. Should she have any questions, then please get in touch."
Amber,"You have shown yourself to be a dedicated student in class, working hard and participating well in both class work and group discussions. However, out of class your engagement has not always been as consistent, and it is for this reason that your rating is amber at this point in time. This is where you need to focus your attention, ensuring that you complete all work in a timely manner so that you stay on top of your workload. We have discussed this in a constructive tutorial, so I am hopeful going forward."
Amber,Roatana's engagement with this course has been patchy. She oftens seems to fall behind with the assigned task: the asynchronous activity was completed during the class presentations and the homework this week was not done. I recommend allocating more time for this course and improving her organisational and time-management skills.
Pink,A very good attendance level but should access preparation and homework on a regular basis in order to ensure the best result. I have the impression that Rotana is now fully acquainted with the systems that she has to engage with.
Pink,"Rotana's first set of mock exam results have not gone well and have shown her performance needing immediate attention as she did not achieve a pass mark of 40% for reading, writing and listening. I feel that she has not truly focused on her English studies as much as she should have in term 1. Greater engagement and participation will help her better understand the specifics of academic English, and she should take full advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare."
Pink,"There are several areas for you to work on in Literature. First, your participation in class needs some attention: you are reluctant to take part in discussions, meaning that it hard for you to make progress and for me to gauge your progress. There have also been some issues around your completing your asynchronous work. Additionally, your formative assignment result shows that you have a lot of hard work to do if you want to progress, and you will need to be more dedicated to achieve that aim."
Pink,"Rotana needs to work very hard to achieve progression. Whilst her submission for the Formative 1 constitutes a very serious case of plagiarism, her class engagement she has shown a lot of interest in the module. I recommend that she allocates more time on weekly basis to this module to complete the homework and asynchronous activities, as well as the readings. I also advise her to act on the advice she receives on her writing and to seek support in order to improve the quality of her submissions."
Pink,"Rotana has very good attendance but  has taken some time to get used to the systems associated with online learning. Rotana needs to ensure that she does the work on Moodle every week.

In addition, Rotana should read the feedback from her formative assignment very carefully and contact me if she is unclear on any of the points made. In particular, she needs to learn about academic conventions in her writing. Providing she makes a concerted effort to do this, I am hopeful that she'll make good progress."
Pink,"Rotana's first set of summative results have not shown much improvement since the mock exams, and has not achieved a pass mark of 40% for reading, writing and listening. I believe that she has had some health issues that have affected her performance.
To help her prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help her pass the exams. In addition, she should also focus on her CW2 and 3, and think about resubmitting CW1 in the resit period. Finally, she should seek the help necessary to achieve her end goal."
Pink,"You still have a lot of work to do if you want to improve in Literature. Your Summative resit was not particularly successful and you did not submit a Formative 2, meaning that you have a huge amount of work to do with Summative 2 in order to ensure that your average improves. Recently, there have been signs that you are starting participate more in class, which is a welcome change - this needs to be consistent and developed much more for the final weeks of the course, as well as backed up with asynchronous work, if you are to improve your final result."
Amber,"Rotana's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 showed very good progress in terms of subject-specific research and analytical skills. However, in the recent weeks her engagement with the course has again decreased which appears to have impacted primarily on the knowledge and understanding of the themes discussed. I recommend that she allocates enough  time for the preparation of the Summative 2 and focuses exclusively on the final assessments in these last weeks."
Amber,"While your Summative 1 result was excellent, this is Amber because you have failed to submit a Formative 2. Likewise, in the short time since I've started teaching you again you have been absent in half of the classes. This leaves me slightly worried as you have not had the chance to practice writing a sociology essay, and I have no way of knowing what your level of essay-writing is like. Please make sure to make the most of the time you have left and try to send me a draft in time for our individual tutorial."

Your participation in AES Online tasks and other online activities such as the Flipgrid has been very good, and I hope that you feel you are benefitting from this. You are doing well with all the skills work too and scored well in all mock exams. Keep up the good work."
Pink,"There is a mixed picture here: your classwork has been exemplary, showing that you are engaging with course materials, and that you are happy to work hard. You contribute to group discussions and make apposite comments in class discussions. However, your formative mark was disappointing, which is why you have a 'pink' here, but we will discuss that in your tutorial and strategies to avoid that situation for your summative. However, there is plenty for you to be positive about looking ahead!"
Green,"You have had a very good term, engaging with the material well, consistently doing the homework in time, working very hard and conscientiously, and this was reflected in your excellent formative grade. Your contributions in class, and the questions you ask, always display your excellent level of understanding and thinking, so please keep it up and always feel free to ask anything during class. Particularly impressive has been your willingness to research deeper and further into topics, as evidenced by many of your class activities and the presentation homework. I am confident this will put you in an excellent position to introduce references to secondary literature and contextual information for the upcoming summative."
Green,"Billy is a highly committed student who asks very intelligent questions and makes valuable contributions to class discussions. She is an insightful and critical thinker who is able to pick out weaknesses in arguments, which is very impressive at this level.

Billy's work is of a good standard and will improve further, if she takes note of the feedback.

Similar to the other students, Billy needs to become conversant with Harvard referencing."
Green,"You have established goals for your academic achievement and you are working diligently to attain them. You share your ideas and research skills in preparing for group presentations, and you are a co-operative, responsible individual. Careful planning and a conscientious attitude are positive aspects of your online class participation and behaviour. You are responsive to feedback, and you build positive relationships with your peers and tutors. Congratulations on your achievements so far and I would like to encourage you to continue in this positive, responsible manner for the remaining part of the course. Suffice to say that you are well on your way to achieving the marks needed for progression to your chosen UG course at RHUL."
Amber,"After a disappointing Formative 1, you managed to get things back on track with Summative 1 - well done. You are amber here because of a slightly weaker mark for Formative 2, but with hard work and careful attention to feedback, there is no reason why you shouldn't translate this into success in Summative 2. In class, you are a conscientious student, paying attention to class discussion and group work. Moreover, it is clear that you are devoting time to the asynchronous work. Overall, there is much to be pleased with here - well done."
Green,"You have continued to work well and conscientiously this term, frequently making valuable contributions to class discussions, and regularly completing the asynchronous activities. Your efforts were rewarded with an excellent score in your Summative 1, so well done and you can be proud of yourself.

What I recommend now is that you keep on track for Summative 2, by choosing an essay question and revising the relevant topics. Try to get started on making the video essay as soon as possible and manage your time well. You are capable of getting an excellent grade as long as you make sure to engage with theoretical and analytical aspects of the module, and do some appropriate research/reading."
Green,"Your Summative 1 result was very good and your Formative 2 showed promise.
You have already started work on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing and puts you in a strong position. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Amber,"Ragad is one of the quieter students in my class and I would like to see her contributing more to class discussion and during smaller group activities. Small contributions every week will help her build more confidence and to be less shy amongst her peers. One other area is homework. Ragad needs to be more consistent in submitting her homework, as this will allow me to better monitor her progress and provide feedback."
Green,"Ragad appears to be a very good student. Her attendance is good and she appears engaged in the content of the classes. She can be a little quiet, but is very able to make contributions to class discussions when asked. She is also able to give good answers to questions when asked directly."
Green,"57% on diagnostic test. Overall, very well-behaved and diligent student with a lot of maths knowledge and high attention to detail. Good first 5 weeks of term 1!"
Amber,"You show some interest in the class and need to make more effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussions in breakout rooms. As of now, your moodle engagement seems good you should aim for the high score to attain it, you should actively engage in all the asynchronous activities in moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. You have to be with a determination to do high."
Amber,"Ragad’s first set of mock exam results have shown that she needs to focus on her English studies if she is to achieve progression. As she did not take the writing exam this has affected her overall outcome. Although she passed her listening, reading and speaking, there is still room for improvement, and so for the coming summative exams, Ragad, should take full advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare, and seek further support from her AES tutor."
Green,Ragad is generally a positive student although she has lately become a little quiet. I am not quite sure whether this is because she is lacking in confidence or if she is losing energy as the course progresses. Having said that her formative 1 result was good and as long as she can maintain this level going forward she is very likely to succeed.
Green,"76% in F1, nice work! This is a dilligent if quiet student. She is very methodical in her approach. She pays attention in class consistently and helps others during group work. In the future please review intergration (definite/indefinite integrals) as well as factor theorem."
Pink,"You are a quiet student. Although you show some interest in class, you need to make more effort to communicate with your peers and participate in group discussions in breakout rooms. Your formative assessment score is 36%.  It shows you need to improve your engagement and work hard. To improve need to concentrate and complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle. Memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. With a little of hard work, you can progress do show your capabilities in term 2."
Amber,"Ragad’s summative exams have shown that she is meeting progression in most of her skills except writing in which she failed to achieve a pass grade. Thus, to help her prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing exam booklet as a resource that will best help her reach progression and to attend writing workshops. In addition, she should focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result."
Green,"Ragad is a good student. She is generally quiet in class, but when asked to contribute she does this very well and is able to answer questions clearly. Her results so far are good and her 2nd formative assignment (which is very challenging) showed a good result. Ragad's attendance has been a little patchy so she needs to maintain her focus and I expect Ragad to have a very successful outcome this year."
Amber,"This student works hard during class and pays attention. It would be great if she could participate more in group discussion. 86% in S1, well done.

However, this student failed F2 so will need to attend tutorials and workshops before S2 exam."
Pink,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance. However, I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to succeed."

Green,"Florence, you performed very well in the first six weeks of the semester, but I am concerned by your absences in the last few weeks. Please don't hesitate to talk to me if you have any issues.
I am giving you a green because I believe this is only temporary, and your work is still consistently good."
Green,"Your work has been truly excellent this term and for that you should be commended. You have worked very hard, engaged well and shown that your understanding of the texts is very clear. Your classwork is excellent: you make insightful contributions to class discussions and work well in groups. Your homework is also excellent showing you have spent time preparing. All of this has paid off in your assignment mark which is richly deserved. All in all, a very good term's work. To continue this next term, carry on working hard and think about engaging with the extra materials on Moodle pertaining to each of the texts to help deepen your understanding of them."
Green,"69% in F1. Missed a few lessons recently but diligent and positive student. Keep up the good work! In future essays, please add even more independent reading and ensure you reference correctly. I have been so far impressed with your motivation and knowledge of psychology."
Green,"Florence has an excellent record of attendance, missing only 1 class due to IT issues. She is very conscientious student and this is reflected also in her formative assignment, where she attained a very good mark. Nonetheless, I believe she can do even better than this, and she should continue to focus on her learning the way she does now."

Pink,"When present and focused Florence is a very strong member of the group. Unfortunately, recently she seems to be having issues both with attendance and motivation in  AES.."
Green,"Your performance throughout the year has been strong, including your written work. While you have done well in classwork and group work, this has not always been entirely consistent. However, your written work is highly consistent, showing a dedication to the subject and an ability to think critically which is perceptive. What we need to concentrate on now is ensuring that you perform to the best of your ability in the final summative assignment. This is something we will be discussing both in class and in your tutorial."
Green,"83% in S1, excellent work. This is a very dilligent student with an excellent writing style. She has been more absent from class or quieter recently, so in the future, it would be great if you could engage more in class discussiions."
Green,"Overall you have had a very good term, your latest formative showed your ability and writing skills, and your contributions in class are consistently excellent. We have spoken about your potential issues when it comes to deadlines and stress, so please take full advantage of the time you will have over the break to stay on top of the sociology material, and to begin planning and preparing for your final summative. If you remain motivated and manage your time, you are certainly capable of achieving a very high grade for the final essay. So please take the positives from this term, and keep up the great work."

Amber,"Rawan is a conscientious student who contributes well to class discussion and group activities. In coming weeks I would like to see her consistently engaging with the on-line English platform and submitting her homework. It will enable me to both monitor her progress and provide appropriate feedback. Should she have any questions, then please get in touch."
Green,Rawan appears to be a very good student. Her attendance is good and she appears to be engaged in class topics very well. She is very able to offer answers to questions in class and participates well in class discussions. Her understanding of the topics covered so far appears to be good.
Amber,"You are a pleasure to teach and show significant interest in the class. You participate in group discussions and are fully involved in the work that we undertake. I’d like to see you achieve a good score. To attain a good score, you should actively complete all asynchronous activities on Moodle. Memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. Do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook."
Amber,Rawan appears engaged and is starting to contribute more to seminars. This is promising. Rawan should remember to complete preparation and homework each week.
Amber,"Rawan’s first set of mock exam results have shown that she needs to focus on her English studies if she is to achieve progression. Her reading and listening skills achieved just over the 40% pass mark, and even though her writing and speaking are her stronger skills there is still a lot of room for improvement. For the coming summative exams, Rawan, should take full advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare."
Pink,"Rawan is a good student who seems to be engaged in class. However, Rawan's formative 1 mark was much lower than I was expecting and shows some cause for concern. I have made an appointment with Rawan for next week for a tutorial where we will talk about how to improve her marks. In order for Rawan to succeed this year she will need to make a genuine commitment to her studies to realise her talents."
Amber,"You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate some command of the subject. It is clear from your most recent formative assessment score that is  52%. You do need to put in more effort though, to succeed and you do need to stretch yourself further. Improve your performance by following all the asynchronous actives on Moodle and memorise the glossary from the text. This should help you improve your scores further."
Pink,"Rawan makes helpful contributions to the classes. There was a problem with her formative assignment as she hadn't really understood what was required. Hopefully, Rawan now appreciates the importance of reading the assignment briefly carefully and of responding to the questions directly with only relevant information."
Amber,"Rawan’s summative exams have shown that her speaking and listening to be her strongest language skills, scoring above 60%. However, reading and writing are skills that require strengthening, and to help her prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing exam booklet as a resource that will best help her reach progression. In addition, she should also focus on her CW1, 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve her end goal."
Pink,"Rawan is a good student. She is mostly successful in remaining engaged in class and will often ask questions confidently. She often contributes to class discussions and will answer questions readily. However, her summative 1 result was not as good as we hoped and she has not submitted a formative for her second assignment so feedback is difficult. My advice to Rawan is to really commit herself to working hard and doing her best as I feel that she has the capability to succeed on this course, but only if she applies herself rigorously."
Amber,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week, I cannot comment on past performance. However, I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to succeed."
Amber,"You did really well in improving your Summative 1 result in the resit, so well done for that. However, this is Amber mainly because you have not been able to complete Formative 2. This therefore leaves me slightly worried as you have not had the chance to practice writing a sociology essay. Please make sure to make the most of the time you have left and try to send me a draft in time for our individual tutorial next week."

Green,Noor is a conscientious student who contributes well to class discussion and group activities. She has already built a nice rapport with her classmates. She is engaging with the on-line English platform and is consistently submitting her homework which enables me to both monitor her progress and provide appropriate feedback - keep up the good work.
Green,Noor appears to be a very good student. Her attendance is good and she participates well in class. She is able to answer questions when asked and participates well in class discussions. Her understanding of the material covered so far appears good.
Amber,You are a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest in the class. You proactively participate and demonstrate a command of the subject.  You do need to stretch yourself further by completing all the asynchronous actives on Moodle. Memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. Do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your success.
Amber,"A promising start to the module. Noor appears to be engaged and appears to do her homework on a regular basis. Noor is starting to contribute to group discussions, and her contributions are always useful."
Amber,"Noor possesses strong English language skills. However, because she did not fully participate in her first set of mock exams it was not possible to measure her overall performance as she missed the reading and writing exam. I believe that if she had taken the exams and judging from her class performance she would have done very well. In the meantime, I strongly recommend, Noor, to take advantage of the reading and writing, and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform as a way to continue her exam preparation."
Amber,"Noor remains a good student who is motivated and engaged in class. However, her formative 1 result was a little disappointing. Noor shares this disappointment and I feel very confident that she is very capable of making use of the feedback in order to improve her marks going forward."
Green,"You are a good student, however, your concentration level in class is lower than before. It is evidenced by your recent summative assessment score (62%). You have the potential to progress, although you do need to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. Do complete all the asynchronous activities on Moodle. Memorising the glossary from the Kortext textbook will help you do this. Do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your progression."
Pink,"Noor makes some very valuable contributions in class.
While Noor appears to understand the key concepts, she needs to work on the presentation and structure of her written work."
Amber,"Noor has performed reasonably well in her summative assessments, but still needs to put in more effort to push her grade up further to the 50% in reading and CW1 in order to meet progression. To help her prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing exam booklet as a resource that will best help her improve. In addition, she should also focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve her end goal."
Amber,"Noor is a very good student who remains engaged in class. She is confident in asking questions and readily attempts to answer questions in class. Her summative 1 result was very good, but unfortunately she did not submit a formative for her second assignment so it is difficult to assess her recent progress. However, overall I remain optimistic about Noor's prospects."
Green,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance, but I can stress that having a green colour for the last RPAG means that you are doing well, so keep up the good work. I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to exceed and succeed."
Amber,"Your Summative 1 result was good and in the short time I've taught you, your class contributions have also been strong and appreciated. However, this is Amber mainly because you have not been able to complete Formative 2. This therefore leaves me slightly worried as you have not had the chance to practice writing a sociology essay. Please make sure to make the most of the time you have left and try to send me a draft in time for our individual tutorial next week."

Amber,"Orjwan joined the class in week 3, and is still getting use to the subject. We have had a meeting to bring her up to speed on what she has missed, but to support her further I will monitor her more closely in the coming weeks, particularly as we are approaching the formative assessment period. Should she have any questions, get in touch and I will be happy to assist."
Amber,"You have made a good effort to catch up with the work you missed at the start of term. However, you remain quiet in class and this is an area you need to work on, especially as your engagement outside class can be somewhat patchy. All in all, you have promise but need to apply yourself more consistently to the course in order to be successful. It is perfectly possible and after our tutorial I think you understand what needs to be done."
Green,"Orjwan has made a very good start to the term. She is a conscientious student who has done the homework regularly and demonstrated her understanding. She does not yet participate that much in class but has been participating in smaller group discussions and, when she is asked to, she is able to express her ideas and opinions. I'm confident and hopeful that, as the term goes on, she will get even better at contributing in class."
Amber,Orjwan is an organised and reliable student who is working well. Orjwan should try to contribute to seminar discussions.
Pink,"Orjwan’s first set of mock exam results have shown that she needs to focus more on her English studies if she is to achieve progression, in particular, her reading as she did not achieve a pass mark of 40%. Although she passed her listening and writing, there is still a lot of room for improvement, and so for the coming summative exams, Orjwan, should take advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare, and seek further support from her AES tutor."
Green,"You are going from strength to strength in Literature. After a tutorial in which we discussed your progress so far, it is clear you have made an effort to work on my feedback which has been good to see - keep it up! You have been rewarded with a very good assignment mark and if you keep up this mature attitude to feedback, you are in a good place to do well in your summative assignment. All in all, you should be pleased with the way you have progressed this term."
Amber,"You have worked hard this term and proven yourself a conscientious student, despite having missed the first two weeks of term. You have started to contribute more in class, which is excellent, so please keep doing so. Your formative showed some promise, although I know you were slightly disappointed with the grade. This can certainly be improved upon for the summative --- just try to use the upcoming weeks to revise the terminology of film codes & conventions. We also will discuss how to improve your analysis skills in our upcoming tutorial."
Pink,"Orjwan is an exemplary student in terms of her attendance and the regularity with which she engages with Moodle. Her formative assignment was not successful as she was not aware of some very important academic conventions. I am hopeful that future assignments will work out much better, if Orjwan takes note of the feedback. It would be nice to hear more from Orjwan in future classes."
Pink,"Orjwan’s summative exams have shown that her speaking (68%) and writing (58%) to be her strongest language skills. However, listening and reading are skills that require strengthening as she did not achieve a pass grade. Thus, to help her prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help her reach progression. In addition, she did well in CW1, and now she should focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result."
Amber,"Your Summative 1 result was very good - well done. Your Formative 2 was also strong, if slightly lower. However, you are working hard and with continued engagement there is no reason why you should not achieve the final result you need in order to be successful. Your class participation is improving and you work well in groups. All in all, there is plenty to be pleased about - you just need to keep this up for the final stages of the course and ensure that your Summative 2 is a strong piece of work."
Green,"You have continued to work well this term, and for the most part been regular in completing asynchronous activities. You also did well for your Summative 1 which you can be pleased about.

One area for improvement remains classroom engagement. I do know you have had connection issues, and have tried to engage via the chat function. However, it would be even better if you could engage more in the class, so that I could be able to monitor how well you are understanding the concepts.

What I recommend now is that you keep on track for Summative 2 by revising the relevant topics, and get started on making the video essay. You are capable of getting a very good grade as long as you make sure you've fully understood the theoretical and analytical aspects of the module. If necessary, feel free to reach out to me for extra help."
Green,"You did well in improving your Summative 1 result in the resit, so well done for that. Your Formative 2 showed a lot of promise and you have clearly already started work on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Your participation in AES Online tasks and other online activities such as the Flipgrid has been very good, and I hope that you feel you are benefitting from this. Areas to work on include speaking and writing. Generally, your speaking is good, though there are some things you could do to improve it. For seminars, make sure you are participating actively and using some language and techniques covered on AES Online and in-class to structure and extend your contributions. Keep working at writing by reviewing content covered on AES Online in Term 1 to better structure and organize your ideas. It would be a good idea for you to attend the AES Writing workshops on Mondays to get some extra feedback and practice."
Green,Ndekazi is a very good student who is engaged in class and shows interest in the subject. I am pleased to say that she is now beginning to develop her confidence in class discussions and I hope that this continues to grow. Her formative 1 mark was very good and I am very optimistic about Ndekazi's success this year overall.
Amber,"You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate some command of the subject. It is clear from your most recent formative-1 assessment score is  56%. A lot of effort is needed to attain success need to stretch yourself further. Improve your performance by following all the asynchronous actives on Moodle. Memorise the glossary from the text-book, this should help you ensure improve scores required for progression."
Pink,"Ndekazi makes positive and valuable contributions to class discussions.

Her assignment was not very successful, but I suspect that this is because she is not familiar with academic conventions. If she takes the advice provided on the feedback for her formative assignment, she will be able to improve her writing significantly.

As is the case with all the students in the group, Ndekazi need to become conversant with Harvard referencing"
Green,"You demonstrate good speaking skills as evidenced by 72% in Summative Speaking Assessment and you make frequent contributions to class discussions. You share your ideas and research skills in preparing for group presentations, and you are a co-operative, responsible individual. You worked hard in the previous terms in order to improve your writing skills and managed to achieve a mark of 58% in the Summative writing exam. What is more, you have made noticeable progress in terms of your reading and research skills as demonstrated in CW1 where you were awarded a mark of 58%. Kazi, if you continue to work on your academic skills development in Term 3, you should progress to your chosen UG course at Royal Holloway University of London."
Amber,"Ndekazi remains a very good student. She shows great engagement in class and is often able to answer difficult questions when asked. Her summative 1 result was generally good and her formative 2 assignment shows great promise, although it will need to improve for the summative to ensure her progression. Ndekazi has shown great maturity in considering the feedback she has received and I remain very optimistic about her progress to the next stage of the course."
Amber,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance. However, I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to succeed."
Green,"Your Summative 1 result was very good and your Formative 2 showed promise.
You have already started work on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing and puts you in a strong position. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Although he passed his listening, speaking and writing, there is still a lot of room for improvement, and so for the coming summative exams, Suleman, should take full advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare, and seek further support from her AES tutor – by doing so, I am sure he will reach progression."
Green,"Your attendance for applied maths is very good and you always participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by the tutor and usually finish your homework. Your F1 is 63% which is acceptable for F1 since it was your first assessment, you are now more familiar with the way that the questions would come up in the exam and how to solve and write your answer. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the Formative 2 and summative 1."
Amber,"Your attendance for physics is very good. You participate in the class discussions and solve the questions given by your tutor. You also usually finish and submit your homework. Although your F1 was not very high, but I remember that your informed me that you had the COVID-19 vaccine and had fever in the time you were supposed to do the exam; nevertheless, I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the summative 1."
Green,Suliman has a positive attitude towards his studies. His contribution and participation in the class activities is very good. I believe he can improve his performance by a proactive approach and studying the content for the timetabled sessions beforehand.
Pink,"Suliman’s summative exams have shown that his listening and speaking to be his strongest language skills. However, his writing and CW1 assessment are areas that require strengthening as he did not achieve a pass grade. Thus, to help him prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing exam booklet as a resource that will best help him reach progression and attend writing workshops. In addition, he should focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result."
Amber,"Your attendance for applied maths classes is good, and you have missed a few sessions since 20/05/2021. Your summative 1 grade is 67%, and you only need 64% from you summative 2 in order to progress to the university this September. Therefore, I strongly recommend you to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation and attend your applied maths classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Amber,"Your attendance for Physics class has been decrease. I heard from your peers that you were sick; nevertheless, you did not email me directly. This also caused you to miss your physics summative 1 resit assessment. Since your summative 1 grade is 58%, you need to obtain at least 70% from your summative 2 assessment in order to be able to progress to the university in September. Therefore, I strongly recommend you to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation and attend your physics classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Amber,"Suliman has a positive attitude towards his studies. His contribution and participation in the class activities are also good. He needs to improve his attendance. He was absent for past 3 sessions, during which he missed the formative 2. He needs to work on the material learnt for summative 2 as it is approaching soon, and he needs to prepare well to improve his scores."

Although he passed his listening, reading and speaking, there is still room for improvement, and so for the coming summative exams, Zayed, should take full advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help him prepare, and seek further support from his AES tutor – by doing so I am sure he will reach progression."
Amber,Your attendance for applied maths is very good. You usually participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by your tutor and usually finish your homework. Your F1 was 55% which needs improvement for F2 and S1. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the Formative 2 and summative 1.
Amber,"Your attendance for physics is very good. You always participate in the class discussions and usually solve the questions given by your tutor. You usually finish your homework. Your F1 was about 60% which shows you need to do more revision, although it is not very low, but remember at the beginning of the year we aimed for over 80% for the assessments, so, I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the summative 1."
Amber,"Zayed is a good student and he puts in a sufficient level of effort while studying. He has the potential to achieve even better results, however, he needs to practice the fundamentals to fully understand the subject. I highly recommend him to attend all the workshops to discuss topics further, especially the ones where he struggles a bit more than usual. For the upcoming summative assessment 1, he needs to be prepared and revise the topics. Zayed has been told that he can seek extra help from me as well as the workshops."

In addition, he should focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result."
Green,"You have missed quite a few sessions of your applied maths, some of which were due to some financial issues. Your summative 1 grade is 77% which makes you able to progress to the university this September if you only obtain about 60% of your summative 2. Therefore, I recommend you to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation and attend your applied maths classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Green,"Your attendance has significantly improved since 17/05/2021, before which you had missed a few sessions. You made a great improvement in your summative 1 resit (your provisional grade is 77%). Now it is time to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation and attend your physics classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Green,"Zayed has been active in his class participation and homework. He has shown his capabilities in the assessments. Whereas, he still struggles during class discussions and individual exercises. He has done well for formative 2 and managed to score 92%. He needs to keep practicing and prepare for the upcoming Summative 2."

Green,"Francesca has  been active in class, and she has engaged with group discussions, Padlet submissions and quick question-answer activities. She has an excellent attendance rate of 96% in her machine fundamentals classes. She has managed to improve her programming skills and technical English skills. I am happy that she asks questions when she has one, and she can follow my instructions in technical terms. She should continue to maintain her level of attendance and engage with class activities to maintain/improve her level of performance."
Green,"Francesca has an excellent attitude towards her studies. Her attendance and participation in the class activities are very good. However, she only managed to score 57% in SA1. She lost some of the marks due to minor mistakes. She has the potential to achieve better results. She has been told about workshops and that I am also available for additional support and tutorials."
Pink,"Francesca actively engages with class activities and she asks questions when she needs help. However, her performance in the latest summative assessments does not represent her level of class engagement. She needs to read the questions carefully and pay attention to feedback provided in the assessments. I am sure that if she works hard and remains focused during assessments, she will manage to meet her progression requirements and progress to second year of her studies."
Amber,"She seems to be making good progress with the Programming Laboratory module, and I am happy to confirm that she actively engages with class activities and given instructions. 
She can follow technical instructions in online sessions and she can communicate her problems clearly. However, she need to read the questions carefully to gain a clear understanding of requirements of each part of the question before attempting to answer them. She should practice to remain focused when solving problems and evaluate her code to assure that the developed snippet achieves the speciations set out in the question(s). She is a quick learner and I am sure that if she continues to work hard and practice with examples and exercises in the notes, she will improve her problem-solving skills. She can also join group learning meetings on Zoom or Teams to work with her classmates."
Green,Francesca has done well in the S1 (81%). Her attendance is very good and she participates actively in each session. She should keep up the good work.
Green,Well done. You have passed the module and met your progression requirements.
Green,Well done on successfully passing the module. Keep up the good work in the next semester.
Green,"You are active in class, and you have demonstrated an excellent level of engagement in class activities. You ask questions where you have one, and you have attended workshop sessions when you had questions. 
Please keep up the hard work and continue to practice with examples and exercises in notes. You need to remain focused during assessments and read the questions carefully. If you cannot understand a question during an assessment, please feel free to ask for help. If your questions cannot be answer due to assessment conditions, then you will be notified of this, otherwise, assistance will be available, and you have a better understanding of the question. Please review the concept of objects and classes and their applications in Object-Oriented Programming."
Green,"Well done, You have passed and met your progression requirements. You may wish to review and practice with examples and exercises from IY1_OOP I to improve your performance in IY1_OOP II."
Green,"I am happy to confirm that you hare happy in class, and you engage with class activities. You ask questions where you need help and you have demonstrated good time management and planning in your studies. However, your score in the second summative assessment does not demonstrate your full potential. I am confident that this is due an extenuating circumstances (you were travelling) and you will do better in the resit opportunity. 
Please keep up the hard work, continue to practice with examples and exercises in the module and engage with class activities."

Amber,"The reason I have given Rayna an amber instead of green is because I am slightly concerned about her engagement and motivation in AES.
I think Rayna is capable of good AES results and when she does contribute in seminars what she says is always valuable.
Moving forward please make sure you go over all the new concepts introduced on the Insendi screens, and please ask me any questions you might have. Also, please make sure you do more reading and research on the seminar topics, both for the live sessions and for assessments."
Green,"Qinxin is a student with a very good attendance record. She scored a very good mark for the IB summative 1. She seems committed to this module, and she can continue to work hard and aim to achieve her best."
Green,"Qinxin is distracted in most seminars and does not get very involved in class but, she does complete the work required."
Green,"Qinxin is distracted in most seminars and does not get very involved in class but, she does complete the work required."
Pink,Qinxin attends all her classes and she is trying hard. She gained a 3rd class mark for QM summative 1. She has done better in her IB work. She can work harder to further develop her quantitative skills.
Green,"There has been a marked improvement in Rayna's performance in AES over the last couple of months. I was very pleased with the exam results in all three skills, and provided Rayna focuses on the upcoming coursework assignments she will achieve progression from AES."
Green,"Qinxin is doing quite well in her studies. She can become more participative in class discussion. She has very good attendance in general.  No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,"Qinxin gets on with the work and does what is expected of her. My advice to her would be to work on ensuring she is also working hard outside of class to ensure she is stretched and extending her knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Qinxin from amber to green."
Amber,"Qinxin seems to be a good student, but she is very quiet in class. An important step is to keep her camera on and to attempt to answer questions. At the moment, she seems to lack the confidence to tackle questions or to contribute to class discussions. I would also encourage her to ask questions if she finds any topic difficult to understand."
Green,"Qinxin, so far, your attendance, class and moodle engagement have been good but you need to improve on your English-speaking skills. 

Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Amber,
Green,"Qinxin, is continuing to keep up her aims to exceed in her studies, and she has gained a very good mark for FDE S1."
Amber,
Green,"There is a strong determination by Qinxin to succeed in her studies. She is doing quite well, and she has scored a first class mark for IB S2."
Amber,
Green,
Green,"Qinxin, has continued to work hard to improve her QM work. She has achieved a very high mark for her QM S2  and she has also done the S1 resit in order to improve her mark. The result of a first class mark that she obtained for the S1 resit  reflects her determination to exceed in QM."

He can practise these skills doing the activities on AES Online and also there are some supplementary materials on VLE. Hamza has shown his potential and worked well at times . Overall, he is making good progress. He has shown a good knowledge of the topics since the beginning of the term, which could yet be further broadened by practising his academic writing."
Green,I am happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Active during the class and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Your marks for summative assessments 1 and  2 are also satisfactory and shows that you have been working hard. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to be even more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions.
Green,"I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Active during the class and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Although, your mark for summative assessments 1 is a little concerning. I would like you to be even more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I also recommend you to practice maths by solving multiple examples and exercises from the slides and the textbook. I believe more practice is going to help you perform better in your next assessments."
Green,"Your skills as a problem solver, which are the most important skills regarding coding, will develop with the more time you spend training them. So, as you learn to code, try to solve more and more questions. If you are feeling overwhelmed, don’t be: every professional, no matter how successful, started at a base level."
Green,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

It is obvious that he puts a good level of effort into his work. If he can sustain or improve this, it will be a factor in his success. He is making good progress and should aim to maintain or even improve on this going forward. His performance in exams is satisfactory, but should improve his listening and reading skills."
Green,"Hamza is an excellent student, he has managed to work on his web page and develop a good standard work. Hamza was able to score 93% in SA1. He needs to stay consistent with his studies and efforts."
Green,"You have made good progress, well done!! You will progress faster by spending more time studying, including going over the materials on Moodle, revising what you have learnt, working on the exercises and practise coding with Java. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

Pink,"You seem to be making some progress with the module, and you seems to have a positive attitude towards your studies. However, your latest performance in the summative assessment indicates further potential for improvement. Please review the examples and exercises in the notes and make every attempt to attend all remaining sessions. During each session, I like to hear from you with constructive input in the discussions and volunteering for representing your group in group discussions. 
Please read the recommended pages from the textbook as instructed in the lessons and practice with examples in the textbook. 
Feel free to join your friends in group studies on Teams. I am expecting a study plan from you with details of hours of study allocated for each module during the week. You should take your studies seriously and review your study routines and techniques to improve your performance. 
I am confident that if you work hard and attend your classes, you will be able to pass and progress."

Amber,Ingrid has so far demonstrated a good level of language and this can be seen in her mock exam results. She seemingly contributes well to group discussion and sometimes participates in wider class interaction. One area that she should work on is her engagement with the online English platform on which I would like her to complete the screens as instructed each week -- by doing so will help her better understand the specifics of academic English in more detail and place her in good stead for her summative assessments. Keep up the good work.
Green,I am happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Active during the class and submitted all the quizzes and assignments. Your marks for summative assessment  2 is also satisfactory and shows that you have been working harder since summative 1. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to be even more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions.

Green,"Ingrid is smart, independent and creative thinking. I’d advice Ingrid to try a bit more to share her ideas with the rest of the class during discussion, and of course keep practising coding.."
Green,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1.

Amber,"Ingrid's first set of summative exam and assessment results have been mixed with a fail in her reading exam and only just achieving 40% in her CW1. I believe she is capable of achieving better grades. Unless she truly focuses on improving her reading and resubmitting CW1, she is at risk of not achieving progression. She did, however, perform well in her speaking/ seminar. For now, I have awarded Ingrid an amber as I am hopeful and optimistic that she will reach progression. So moving forward Ingrid should access the listening, reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help her prepare for her finals, and act upon the feedback given to her by her AES tutor as this will definitely make a difference to her performance."
Green,Ingrid has an excellent attitude towards her studies. She puts in a good level of effort into her work. She also managed to score 93% in her SA1. She needs to keep working hard to score well in her assessments and progress into RHUL with high scores.

Amber,"You are making good progress with the module, however, there is some space to reach your full potential. You should remain focused during the assessment and read the questions carefully. 
Please speak up during the sessions and represent yourself as a candidate to summarise your group discussions. Do not feel shy to speak up and to make mistake in the class. We all learn from our mistakes. I like to hear more from you in the class activities. Please read the recommended pages from the textbook as instructed in the lessons and practice with examples in the textbook."

He has achieved above 60% in his formative listening, speaking and reading exams, which is an excellent result for this term However, he needs to improve his writing skills. Doing independent study using resources available to her on the AES Online is likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,Taimour is a hard-working student. He gained a very good mark for the IB Summative 1. He just needs to keep up the good work
Green,"Taimour is a good student, very keen on learning and contributes in class. He has shown a lot of improvement in his quality of work. If he keeps this up, he should have no problem progressing."
Amber,"Taimour is a good student, very keen on learning and contributes in class. He has shown a lot of improvement in his quality of work. If he keeps this up, he should have no problem progressing."
Green,"Taimour is a hard-working student  and he has achieved a very good mark in his QM summative 1 assessment.
He is committed to succeed in his studies."
Pink,"Taimour tends to show a fairly good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term, when present. He also contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. However, his overall grades are below the overall English language requirement for his chosen degree. He should work hard to keep up with the progression requirements. He is advised to complete his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. Attending writing workshops is recommended. Doing extensive listening and reading exercises, and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve the chances of his progression."
Green,"Taimour is a conscientious student, and he works hard. He participates in class discussion and has good attendance in general.  No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Green,"Taimour is an enthusiastic student. He always does the work expected from him and is very involved in discussions. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Pink,Taimour is showing poor motivation and engagement in his studies. So far this year he has missed more than 70% of classes on this module.When he is in class he shows poor engagement and does not turn his camera on. Taimour needs to increase his commitment to his studies in order to succeed.
Green,"Taimour, attendance, Moodle and class engagement have been good so far, and you need to keep it up. Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Amber,
Amber,"Taimour keeps up with his work, and he has gained a reasonably good mark for FDE S1. He could aim to upgrade his performance in the S2."
Amber,

Amber,
Green,
Pink,Taimour's standard has fallen since his QM S1 work. He has scored a satisfactory and lower mark for the S2. He must work harder to increase his performance.

Now, my advice would be for Muska to stretch herself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Pink,"Muska is a very articulate and capable student, but she is showing poor attendance of this module and this gives me some concerns about her commitment to her studies. Whilst she is able to give answers to questions when asked at times these answers show that she still has some way to go to develop the necessary understanding for success on the course. Muska does have some talent, but she needs to apply this talent if she is going to succeed going forward."
Amber,"Muska, your class engagement has been good with meaningful contributions from you, but you need to improve on your attendance because it is only by attending synchronous activities that you can have a good class engagement. At the beginning of the semester, your moodle engagement was not the best, but this changed for the better when you were prompted in week 3. 
Now, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Green,"Muska is an outstanding student as reflected in the very high mark she has achieved for FDE S1. She is hard-working, and I expect that she would exceed in the S2."

Amber,"You are participating well in all your live sessions and are a pleasure to have in the class. Continue to show the same enthusiasm and commitment moving forwards to get a good AES grade. Generally, you are making a good effort with the online materials on AES Online, but you could be a little more engaged and push yourself harder by doing some additional tasks as well as the required ones. Remember, the more you practice, the faster you are going to improve. Your mock results were quite good, though keep working hard at writing and seminar participation to ensure you remain on track to progress."
Green,"You have worked hard in Literature this term, showing that you are very conscientious - well done. You are particularly keen to clarify anything that you do not understand. You are also happy to contribute to class discussions and group work, both of which are good to see. You have been rewarded for your hard work with a very good assignment mark, which gives you a strong foundation for your summative work next term. Overall, you should be pleased with your work this term."
Amber,"Overall you have had a good term, but this is 'amber' only because your formative grade was slightly low. However, following our tutorial I believe you are now aware of how to improve going forward to the summative, and I am confident that you are very capable of doing so. In general, in class, you have been excellent, consistently asking very good questions and making very good contributions, so please keep that up. Also, do try to use the Easter break weeks to revise the terminology of film codes & conventions, which should help you as well for the upcoming summative."
Green,"Cherie is an exceptionally strong and committed student, both in terms of the high quality contributions that she makes in class discussions and in terms of her writing which is fluent and demonstrates an excellent understanding of the key concepts and theories. Cherie's work already includes a good level of critical analysis and signs of original thinking. This is impressive. 

I am confident that Cherie has the ability and the commitment to achieve a high grade on this module. I would recommend, however, that she tries to be less anxious and remember that perfectionism isn't achievable. The key thing is to be learning."
Green,"You have experienced good progress in many areas of your academic study over the two terms at RHISC. For instance, you have made noticeable progress in terms of your reading and research skills, as demonstrated in CW1 (73%). Careful planning and a conscientious attitude are positive aspects of your class participation and behaviour. If you continue to work at this level for the remaining part of the course, then you should achieve the required progression mark of 70% in Writing Skills, pass the programme and achieve the grades needed for progression to your UG course at RHUL. Cherie, congratulations on your achievements and I encourage you to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout Term 3."
Pink,"You have mixed results in Literature this term, which is why you are graded 'pink'. While your Summative 1 is good, your Formative 2 was far weaker. It is definitely the case that your Formative 2 did not show how well you can work and for that reason I am hopeful that with continued hard work you will do much better in Summative 2. You engage carefully and thoughtfully in class, and you do the work that is set asynchronously. Therefore, with hard work, you have the tools to be successful in this module."
Green,"While this term has obviously had its difficulties for you, and your attendance and completion of asynchronous activities was affected, you nevertheless managed to complete a very good Summative 1 and should be proud of your efforts.
In class, when present, your contributions have remained valuable and appreciated.
All I recommend now is that you keep on track for Summative 2 by revising the relevant topics, and if necessary catching up on any topics you missed. Try to start working on making the video essay as early as possible and manage your time well. If necessary, feel free to reach out to me for extra help."
Amber,"This is Amber only because you were not able to submit a Formative 2, which means I was therefore unsure of your level of progress for Summative 2. However, you have spoken to me about your thoughts and plans for the final Summative 2 essay, which was positive. I can only recommend that you keep managing and organising your time, so that you do not leave yourself with too little time to finish S2 to the best of your ability. Feel free to reach out to me further if you have any questions related to S2."

Make sure that you participate fully in all class activities to continue making progress. Your online participation with AES Online needs work. Make sure that you are at least completing the tasks assigned each week and try to do some extra activities too. I suggest you go back and visit tasks that you found difficult the first time to get that extra practice that you need. Keep working hard to make the progress you are capable of."
Amber,"Muhammad is generally a good student. He is interested in the subject matter and is clearly engaged in the class. He is often involved in class discussions and will try to answer questions even when he is not sure of the answer - which is good. However, his formative mark was a little disappointing so he must now work on the feedback and commit to developing his capaiblities in order to succeed on the course."
Amber,"You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate some command of the subject. It is clear from your most recent formative assessment score that is  56%. You do need to put in more effort though, to succeed and you do need to stretch yourself further. Improve your performance by following all the asynchronous actives on Moodle and memorise the glossary from the text. This should help you improve your scores further."
Green,"Suleman has made a very good start. He contributes positively to the class discussions and has written a good first assignment.
To maintain his success, he will need to engage in more independent reading which will support him to write in more depth and with greater criticality.

As is the case for all the students in the group, Suleman needs to become familiar with academic conventions, in particular, drawing on academic sources and referencing them."
Green,"In the online classroom, you help to keep the group focused and on task. What is more, you maintain consistent communication with the tutors and co-operate well with other students. You are responsive to feedback, you participate well in synchronous sessions, and you have built positive relationships with both your peers and tutors. Moreover, you achieved high scores in the recent reading and writing summative exams. You were also successful in your summative speaking assessment with the score of 70%. If you continue to work at this level for the remaining part of the course, you should achieve the required progression marks, pass the programme and progress to your chosen UG course at RHUL."
Pink,"Muhammad remains interested in the subject, but his motivation has dipped a little this term. His attendance is a little patchy and when in class his contributions have reduced compared to the first term. His summative 1 result was a little disappointing and unfortunately he did not submit a formative for assignment 2. I remain concerned about Muhammad's prospects of completing the course successfully and he must increase his energy and commitment for the last few weeks if he has any chance of success."
Amber,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance. However, I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to succeed."
Pink,"Unfortunately your S1 resit was slightly disappointing, you have mostly been absent in Term 3 and have also failed to complete Formative 2. This therefore leaves me quite worried at this stage, especially since you have not had the chance to practice writing a sociology essay. Please try to take this S2 seriously, make sure to make the most of the time you have left and send me a draft in time for our individual tutorial."

She could increase her participation in class some more and show her prowess as a very good student. No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,"Fanjie gets on with the work and does what is expected of her. My advice to her would be to work on ensuring she is also working hard outside of class to ensure she is stretched and extending her knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Fanjie from amber to green."

There are areas requiring improvement, particularly in reading where I feel he is capable of well over 70%, rather than the mid 50s achieved in the mock exam.
He should try to do some practice from the exam practice booklet I shared with the class this week."

However, your moodle engagement was not the best at the beginning of the semester as you never accessed the learning materials until you were prompted to do so during the third week. You need to continue to utilise the learning materials provided.

In class, however, you have more that you could do to create a more even picture. We have discussed strategies to improve your participation already and it would be good to see further improvement in this area, particularly as this impacts your group work as well as more general class discussions. In order to continue to be successful, you need to continue to work hard, engage with the materials and work on speaking up in class."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  You received a very good grade for your excellent, very imaginative formative assessment, and you also had excellent attendance, which means that you are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Green,"Eunice's attendance record has been excellent. She is usually very quiet during class and that keeps her from expressing her ideas. Nevertheless, whenever prompted, Eunice was able to answer correctly. In addition, her assessment result was excellent, having the highest mark of the entire class. I have no concerns over Eunice's progression but I would say she can improve on her participation in class a bit."

Green,
Green,Eunice is a very good student who is constantly working hard to learn and improve. She has done very well so far.
Green,"Your marks show how hard you are working and how much this is paying off - so well done. However, while you often speak in group work, you still rarely talk in class discussions which is a real shame. It would be lovely to see you work on that as we move into Term 3 as it would help you develop further as a student. Otherwise, you should be pleased with an excellent term's work in Literature."
Green,"You have had a very good term in film & media, as showcased by your excellent grades in both S1 and F2. Your writing and analytical skills are excellent, and this should keep you in good stead for the written components of the final portfolio assessment. Please use the break to think and plan ahead for summative 2, as I am confident that you have the ability to achieve another excellent grade. In class, when you do speak you make consistently excellent contributions, but you do seem slightly reticent to come forward. It would be great to see you grow in confidence in this regard, maybe by using the chat function to participate more with your contributions and comments. Overall, though, you can be proud of your hard work this term and please keep it up."
Green,"You have had a very good term, showcasing impressive ability, hard work, time management, and have consistently done the homework to a very good standard. All this has been reflected in the way the quality of your written assignments keeps getting better and better. You demonstrate an excellent aptitude for essay writing, the application of concepts, and independent research, which bodes extremely well for your final summative as well as for your future studies at university. One area to work on would be your relative shyness in coming forward to speak during class, as at times I can see you are a bit passive in letting others speak even though you always have plenty of great things to say when you do speak. I hope that with time your confidence in this department will grow. However, overall you are doing great, so please keep up the fantastic work, and you can be very proud of your achievement this term."

Green,"You have worked very hard in Literature this term and it has paid off. You have shown commitment to your studies, thinking about the material we have studied and you are a ready participant to any discussions had, both in class and smaller groups. Your assignment work reflects these wider trends and although you were keen earlier to suggest that things might not be going so well, there is little evidence to suggest that now, as long as you carry on as you are. In order to be successful with your next assignments, carry on with hard work and conscientious approach to class and homework."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated, as were your experiments with Zoom filters. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  You received a very good grade for your excellent Lego-based formative assessment, and you also had excellent attendance, which means that you are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Green,"Kelly has an excellent attendance record. She consistently participates in class while her contributions are very valuable. A conscientious student whose overall engagement and determination is reflected in her very good assessment result as well. She simply needs to continue with similar engagement and determination, which will guarantee her an easy progression at RH."
Green,
Green,
Amber,
Green,
Amber,"Kelly is very strong in some areas of the course, but seems to struggle in her writing. It is essential that she focuses on producing a strong CW3 written assignment in the final part of the course."
Green,"From the start of the course, you have shown yourself to be a committed and engaged student, so well done. You are now reaping the rewards of that in your assignment marks. I know that you are worried about your Formative 2 mark, but we will discuss strategies for improving your mark for Summative 2 both in class and also in your tutorial. You are still performing at a high level across the board and are showing dedication to your studies - so well done."
Green,"Overall, you have had a good term in film & media. I know it began with a disappointing S1 grade, but you have bounced back well from this to do much better in the resit. This was more reflective of your actual ability, and in future I do urge you to really make sure you fully understand the brief. Feel free to reach out to me to double-check when it comes to the final S2 portfolio brief. All in all, however, you have been consistently conscientious and motivated in class, in your presentation, in discussions, so you can be proud of your efforts this term, and please keep it up."
Green,"You have had a good term, and demonstrated an excellent willingness to learn and participate in class discussions, so please keep this up. Both your summative and formative were very good, but what is also positive was how eager you were to keep improving moving forward. Following on from our last tutorial, hopefully you have a clearer sense of how you need to plan and organise your essays for them to have a coherent and logical argument. So, please try to keep revising the concepts, terminology and theories from the module --- the Easter break will be an ideal time for this. This will then put you in a great position to keep participating extremely well in class, as well as to do even better for the final summative. Overall, though, you can be very proud of your term and please keep up the great work."

Amber,"Isabel demonstrates a good learning attitude and homework completion. She contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. However, she has scored below the 60% requirement for the IFY course overall in her listening, reading and writing assessment to date. Given the high entry requirements from RHUL for arts, she needs to improve her listening reading and writing skills. Attending listening and writing workshops is recommended. Doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to her on the AES platform is likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"You have made a conscientious start in Literature and regularly participate in group work, which is good to see. You also participate in class work, though this is something you could build on, especially as it would help you build your confidence. Your assignment was a solid start, with good material for you to take forward, but there are also areas for you to work on so that you are more successful with your summative, and we will discuss these in your tutorial. Overall, a good start in Literature, so well done."
Amber,"You have made a good start in Music and it has been good to see your confidence grow. At the start of the year, you were uncertain of a lot of material, but more latterly you seem much more confident which is good. Moreover, you are starting to ask and answer questions more spontaneously, which is another positive development - keep it up! Your assignment mark was very good and gives you a solid foundation on which to work: we can discuss strategies for improvement at your tutorial. In the New Year, carry on working hard and hopefully you will continue to gain confidence."
Amber,"Isabel has had an excellent record of attendance. She is very conscientious as a student, and she regularly participates and asks questions concerning the topics covered in class. Her Formative Assignment result was good, but she needs to improve in order to achieve a progression mark. She is showing great determination and motivation and I believe if she continues like this she will be able to progress. She needs to act on the feedback offered to her in her Assignment, and I am certain she will have no issues with progressing."

Amber,"Isabel shows good learning attitudes and actively contributes to all class discussions. She has made satisfactory progress so far this term. Her reading skills, however, need further development. I also advise her to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance her critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression. She is also advised to complete her AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate."
Green,"Your work in Literature has consistently improved - well done. You have worked hard, showing dedication to the course and you work particularly well in groups. Particularly notable was your Formative 2 mark, which showed that you have the potential to do well in your final summative assignment. You need to carry on working hard and pay particular attention to feedback given in your tutorial and in class in order to capitalise on this."
Amber,"You have worked reasonably hard in Music, though at times a more mature attitude to your studies would have stood you in better stead. You are still reluctant to contribute in class at times, which is a shame, as this is a good way for you to develop. Gradually we are seeing an improvement in your work (as in the change in level between your Summative 1 and Formative 2) and this is for the better, so please carry on working hard and hopefully we will see a positive outcome regarding progression."
Green,"This term began with a disappointing summative grade but since then you have worked very hard indeed to catch up, and your efforts and motivation have been rewarded with much better grades. In class, there is room for you to improve your engagement and to consistently participate in class discussions. You have at times made excellent contributions and often ask very good questions, so it would be good to see you build on that confidence. Overall though, well done for all your hard work this term and please keep it up."

She has achieved above 60% English language requirement for IY1 programme in her listening, reading and writing assessment to date, which is an excellent result for this term. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!"
Green,Your engagement with both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be impressive.
Amber,"Ei Thet is a good student who seems to be working well this term. She appears to concentrate well in class and shows good focus and attention. Her formative result was good, but she needs to develop a little further in order to succeed this year. I would advise her to participate more in class discussions and try to answer questions when she is asked. By doing this Ei Thet will develop her understanding which will help her progress enormously."
Green,"You have a positive attitude towards your academic work and you have been punctual in all lectures and seminars for Management First where engagement has been impressive. 
Pay attention to the comments you received for your formative assessment to improve on your submission for your summatives."
Green,You are committed to achieving your best in Quantitative Methods.

She is also fully engaged in class and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. Grace has achieved above 60% in both overall grades and in writing, which is above both the overall English language requirement and the sub-requirement in writing for her chosen degree. I am sure she will keep up the good work and do well in the upcoming summative assessments."
Green,"In spite of the difficulties you sometimes face with internet connectivity due to the situation in Myanmar, your attendance, class and moodle engagement have been good so far."
Amber,"Ei Thet gets on with the work and does what is expected of her. My advice to her would be to work on ensuring she is also working hard outside of class to ensure she is stretched and extending her knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Ei Thet from amber to green."
Green,"Your performance in this module has been satisfactory. Although you do not need to resit any of the assessments in this module, you need to carefully consider the feedback on your assessments to help you in your assessments for semester 2."
Amber,
Green,"Good performance in this module. Although you passed this module you  opted to resit MF2 to improve your average. In the next semester, continue with your commitment towards your academics."
Amber,"Ei Thet remains a student with good potential, but she is still very quiet in class and does not contribute to class discussions. However, she is able to answer questions when asked. She has had some difficulties with connection recently and she appears to be trying hard to maintain her studies in spite of these difficulties."
Green,You have encountered some difficulty accessing synchronous activities due to the ongoing situation in your country but your commitment has been commendable. Make good use of the learning materials available in moodle and do not hesitate to contact your tutor if you need any assistance.
Green,Very good and consistent performance in this module. Well done. Do well to apply the quantitative skills acquired in this module in other areas where they are needed.

It is obvious that she puts considerable effort into her studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. Simran is making good progress and should aim to maintain or even improve on this going forward. Her writing exam result is lower than the other components of the exam. She needs to practise academic writing."
Green,Good engagement with both synchronous and asynchronous activities. Incorporate the feedback received for your formative assessment to improve on subsequent assessments.
Green,"Simran is a good student who focusses on her studies well. In class Simran is able to concentrate well and is able to answer questions when asked. She also contributes to class discussions from time to time and this is good. Her formative result was reflective of her good understanding of the course to date and was very good. I expect that Simran will do well on the course overall.  
Going forward I would encourage Simran to participate more in the class discussions to help develop her understanding and knowledge."
Green,"You have tackled your studies with a lot of seriousness. When the first RPAGS were released, you contacted me to find out how you could improve and you have followed the feedback given."

Green,"Your attitude towards your academic work in terms of attendance, class and moodle engagement have been very good. You have continued to show a lot of commitment in this module as you did in the first semester."
Green,"Simran is a very good student. Always gets involved in seminars and workshop, she completes her work to a high standard. Now, my advice would be for Simran to stretch herself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."

She has demonstrated a good understanding of the requirements of academic skills and applies this to her studies. Her first set of mock exam results have shown some good English language skills, although writing is an area that needs to be strengthened over the coming weeks -- she has already taken steps to address this and I hope that she continues to do so, as I believe that she will do well and achieve her required progression. Keep up the good work."
Green,I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record and fairly active during the class and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Your marks for summative assessments 1 and  2 are also satisfactory and shows that you have been working hard. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to be more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions.
Green,I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Active during the class and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Your mark for summative assessments 1 is also satisfactory. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to be even more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I also recommend you to practice maths by solving multiple examples and exercises from the slides and the textbook.
Green,"LIM is hard-working and conscientious and tries her best to do well in her subjects. My advice would be to try being more active in class and confidently ask questions, share your ideas and seek help about your work to cover topics."
Green,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

I hope that Cheuk Wing continues to maintain this level of performance as I am sure she will achieve progression. Two areas that she should focus on are her reading and writing as these are her lowest scores in the exam. Moving forward, Cheuk Wing, should access the reading and writing exam practices on the on-line English platform to help her prepare for her finals."
Green,"Cheuk is an excellent student. She puts in a very good level of effort into her studies. She also managed to score 93% in SA1. She only needs to work on her participation in the class activities. With similar consistency, she should be able to complete this course successfully."
Green,"You have made good progress. You will progress faster by spending more time studying, including going over the materials on Moodle, revising what you have learnt, working on the exercises and practise coding with Java. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly and be sure to spend time working on assignments to submit them on time."

You have demonstrated a good level of engagement with class activities and you have done well in the first summative assessment.  Please make every effort to attend all remaining sessions and engage with the class activities. I like to hear more from you in group conversations and Padlet summaries. Keep up the hard work and aim to complete the recommended reading tasks from the textbook to maintain your level of performance."

Given the high entry requirements from RHUL for arts, she needs to improve her listening, reading and writing skills. Attending listening and writing workshops is recommended. Doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to her on the AES platform is likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,"You have worked hard this term and it has paid off in a very good assignment mark, so well done. Your engagement has noticeably improved in the last few weeks, which has also been a delight to see - please keep that up! Now, it is fair to say that you are highly engaged in class discussions, group work, and written work - and this stands you in very good stead for what is coming up in the course. Please ensure you carry on working hard in order to continue to be successful and push yourself still further."
Green,"Nazima has shown good progress since the start of the term. She is conscientious and hard-working, and submits her assignments on time. Her grade for Formative 1 reflects a good subject-specific knowledge and analytical skills. I value a lot her class contributions which show a very good insight. She needs to allocate more time to improve her Academic writing and for this reason I recommended that she starts attending the AES workshop. I also advise her to read more regularly in order to improve both the subject-specific knowledge."
Amber,"Nazima has attended the vast majority of the classes. She is usually very talkative during class, and she often has very interesting points to raise. Despite her excellent participation however, her formative assignment was only good - indeed I expected more from her. I think she has the capabilities to attain a progression mark, and she should push herself more in order to do so. Additionally, I believe she can attain an even higher mark (rather than just a progression mark) and she should focus on her learning and studying in order to attain this."

She has also completed her AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. Nazima has achieved above 60% in overall grades, with 70% in writing, which is above the English language requirement for her chosen degree and it is a good result for this term. She may find attending writing workshops would help her improve her academic writing skills. I am sure she will continue to make progress with her positive attitude. Well done!"
Green,"You have consistently performed well in Literature - well done. Your commitment to the subject is evident in your frequent and pertinent contributions to class discussions. Moreover, you work well in groups. Now the focus needs to be on ensuring that you perform to the best of your ability in the final assessment, and we will talk about this in your tutorial, as well as more generally in class. You are most certainly capable of doing well, something you have demonstrated throughout the year."
Green,"Nazima's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 reflected the time and effort she has invested in this course. She has shown a lot of commitment to improve her writing, analytical and research skills. Nazima is very conscientious and hardworking and always submitted her assignments on time. I recommend that she keeps up the good work."
Green,"Overall you have had a good term and your grades have been good. I do feel however that with better time management you could achieve even higher grades, as from the timing of your emails to me it seems you tend to leave the writing of your essays until the final weekend before the deadline... Please use the Easter break and all the time you have, to revise, plan, and research for your final summative in advance. In class, your participation is generally good, but you seem slightly disengaged at times, and not actively taking notes. Remember the best way to learn is actively not passively. You can be very pleased with your efforts all in all, but there is definitely room for you to do even better, so please stay motivated and hard-working into the final term."
Green,"Nazima is a hard-working and conscientious student. She listens carefully in class and focuses well when working independently or as a group. She is also fully engaged in class and shows a good understanding of the concepts introduced so far. Nazima has achieved above 60% in both overall grades and over 70% in the summative writing exam, which is above both the overall English language requirement and the sub-requirement in writing for her chosen degree. I am sure she will keep up the good work and do well in the upcoming summative assessments."

Amber,"Ibrahim demonstrates good learning attitude and homework completion. His listening and writing skills, however, need further development, as he has scored below 40% in his listening and writing assessment to date, which is far below the 60% overall requirement for the IFY course. Attending listening and writing workshops, participating more, doing extensive listening exercises and completing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,Ibrahim is a very active student and appears motivated and energetic in class. He contributes to class discussions and is able to answer questions well when asked. His standard of english is generally good and this supports his good understanding. His insight in class discussions is good and he appears to be doing well on the course. I think that with some reflection on the feedback is capable of improving his marks from formative 1.
Green,"100% in F1! Excellent result, keep up the good work! This study always works diligently in class. In the future, please ensure that you engage even more in class. You could spend time outside of class doing more challenging exercises which can be found in the course handbook on moodle."
Green,"Ibrahim - You are a pleasure to teach and show significant interest in class, participating in group discussions and being fully involved in the work that we undertake. Your score for formative 1 was 62%, which was good, but I’d like to see you achieve an even higher score. To achieve this you should complete all asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook."

Amber,"Ibrahim shows good learning attitudes and contributes to all class discussions. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. He has also completed his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. His listening and writing skills, however, need further development.  I also advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."
Amber,"Ibrahim is a student who appears to have considerable potential, but has seen a decline in his energy and motivation in recent weeks. His contribution in class has noticeably reduced and his engagement with activities has also had lower energy levels. I have spoken with him about this and he does recognise the issue.  In order to complete the course Ibrahim needs to get back to his previous energy levels and maintain his committment all the way to the end."
Green,"77% in F2, 86% in S1. I have been impressed with this students' good attitude and consistent hard work. Keep it up and ensure you engage consistently in class."
Green,Ibrahim - You show significant interest in class and are always ready to participate in group discussions. You should also be proud of your excellent summative score of 82%. Keep up the hard work and engage in more independent reading to enhance your grades even further.

He has achieved above 60% English language requirement for IY1 programme in his listening, reading and writing assessment to date, which is an excellent result for this term. I am sure he will continue to make progress with his positive attitude. Well done!"
Green,Your engagement with both synchronous and asynchronous activities have continued to be impressive.
Green,"Alyee is a good student who has a very positive attitude. He is normally focussed and attentive in class and this bodes well for his future success. He contributes to class discussions and is able to answer questions when asked.  I have suggested to Alyee that he could increase his contributions in class as a way of developing his understanding. Overall, I am very confident about Alyee's success on the course going forward."

Green,"Your attitude towards your academic work in terms of attendance, class and moodle engagement have been very good. Continue to make good use of the resources provided as you work towards your assessments."
Green,"Alyee is an enthusiastic student. He always does the work expected from him and is very involved in discussions. Now, my advice would be for him to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,"Very good performance in this module with a demonstration of high understanding, analytical and evaluation skills."
Green,
Green,Good performance in this module. Keep it up.
Green,Alyee is a good student who often participates in class discussions and is very able to ask questions when needed. His engagement is generally good although I have the impression that at times he loses focus during the lectures. I am very optimistic about Alyee's success this year overall.
Green,"Good attendance, moodle and class engagement in this module so far. Your contribution in class has been particularly commendable. Keep up with this and make good use of the materials available on moodle to help with your preparation for your assessments."
Green,Consistently excellent performance in this module. Well done.

Green,"You have made an excellent start in Literature - very well done. This is demonstrated most clearly in your assignment mark, which is richly deserved. You work very well in groups. Occasionally it would be nice to hear a bit more from you in class, where you can be a touch reticent. You could also push yourself to engage with some of the extra resources on Moodle so that you build up further understanding of the texts we are reading in class: this will stand you in excellent stead for your subsequent assignments."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  You received a good grade for the formative assessment, which demonstrated your amazing art skills, and you had excellent attendance, which means that you are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Green,"Zosia's overall attendance record has been excellent. She does not participate in class that much, but she has good ideas, and she is able to express during classes when asked. Her knowledge of topics is reflected in the result of her assessment. Her Formative 1 result was very good, and she needs to continue with this effort and determination in order to guarantee progression at RH."
Green,

Green,"It is an absolute pleasure to have Zosia in the group. She has a keen, inquisitive mind and is always looking to improve."
Green,"You have clearly worked very hard this term, and it has paid off with very strong assignment marks, so well done. We will discuss strategies to improve your formative work for your final summative assignment in your tutorial. You are still somewhat quiet in class, and it would be nice to see that developed a bit further so that you are either using the chat box more or contributing further to class discussions. Overall, however, you should be pleased with your work in Literature this term."
Green,"You have had a very good term in film & media, especially demonstrated by your excellent analysis in the recent formative assessment. This should keep you in good stead for the written components of the upcoming summative portfolio, as you have consistently demonstrated excellent writing skills and ability to apply concepts. Please try to use the break to think of potential creative ideas to start planning your storyboard. In class, while you did give an excellent presentation, you do seem to be a bit more reticent in coming forward to speak. This could be something you can work on to keep improving, perhaps by using the chat function more often to post your comments, thoughts or questions. Overall, though, you are clearly a very motivated and diligent student, and you can be very proud of your efforts and achievements this term, so please keep it up."
Green,"You have had a very good term, showcasing impressive ability, hard work, time management, have consistently done the homework to a very good standard, and your assignment grades in both summative 1 and formative 2 have reflected this. You demonstrate an excellent aptitude for essay writing, applying concepts, and independent research, which bodes extremely well for your final summative as well as for your future studies at university. One area to work on is your relative shyness in coming forward for class contributions, and it would be great to see you try to do this as you have plenty of great things to say. You may be the kind of student who needs a bit more time to think before speaking, so feel free to use the chat function as well if it is more comfortable for you. However, overall you are doing great, so please keep up the fantastic work, and you can be very proud of your achievement this term."

Green,"Anastasiia, you are always engaged and motivated in our sessions and your contributions to class discussions are valuable. I feel you have the potential to do very well in AES."
Green,"88% in F1. Good job! This student has become much more confident since the start of the year. She needs a bit more time to review notes on her own. Her self-study skills are excellent, keep up the good work. Review solving inequalities, and check your working for errors carefully please."
Green,"Always answers my questions in class, very positive and engaged with homework. 67% on F1 essay. Good job! Keep working on improving evaluation skills please, as well as on your essay structure."
Amber,"Anastasia has an excellent record of attendance. Her participation in class however, can improve as she only responds when prompted. Her determination, effort and motivation needs to improve. She did good in her assignment, but she needs to improve a bit more in order to attain a progression mark."
Green,
Amber,
Green,
Amber,
Amber,"When she attends class Anastasiia demonstrates real ability in AES. Her attendance is an issue which needs to be addressed, however."
Green,"88% in F1, 72% in S1, 40% in F2 (10% marks reduction due to lateness). Anastasiia is a capable student. She sometimes does not turn on her camera and does not want to answer in class. However, most of the time she does try to think through complex questions and to understand. She needs to work on her time management skills to ensure she is not late for assignment submission in the future."
Green,"71% in S1 resit - but lateness so -10%. This is a very able and hard working student who has some time management issues. She needs to work on that as lateness results in mark deduction (-10% if within 24 hours). On the whole, she has a good understanding of the topic and strong evaluation skills."
Amber,"Overall you have had a positive term but with room for improvement. In class, when you do contribute it is always with very welcome comments and answers, but you could be a bit more forthcoming in contributing yourself. Your summative was unfortunately a late submission which meant you lost crucial marks, and then in your resit it felt very rushed. It seemed like you were feeling the stress of the heavy workload and assessment schedule. I strongly urge you to use the extra time over the break to revise the sociology content, as you often seem to not have made notes. Also, use this time to start planning and preparing for Summative 2, as early as possible. Try to stay on top of the topic and manage your time well, in order to achieve the final grade that you are capable of."

Green,"82% in F1, good job! Overall good engagement in class and moodle. Please review the solving inequalities and partial fractions topics."
Green,"Very diligent student. 65% on F1 but better than previous essay. A bit shy but always answers questions and engages with homework. In the future, please remember to plan and structure your essays and focus more on evaluation."
Green,"Lema has attended the vast majority of her classes. She engages with the content and her contributions are valuable for the class. She is a conscientious student, evident also by her mark in the Formative Assignment, which was very good. Nevertheless, I believe she can still improve on this by following the feedback offered to the whole class regarding the use of secondary literature in building up an argument in academic writing."

Green,"72% in S1. Good work, keep it up! A very positive and engaged student. Please work on speaking up during class discussions and pratice essay writing skills to further improve."
Amber,"The term in sociology has had some challenges for you, with many assessments and resits. You have told me that you felt anxiety and stress due to this, and it did reflect in your assessments which seemed quite rushed unfortunately. I really hope you can use the Easter break to recharge your batteries, revise the material, and begin planning/working on the final summative. With extra time to prepare, I really believe you have the ability to achieve higher grades. Finally, in class, you are a bit reticent to engage and it would be very nice to see you improve slightly in this regard. Overall, you can be pleased with your efforts, and please remain motivated for the rest of the module as you can definitely keep doing better."

It is obvious that she puts considerable effort into her studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. Overall she is making good progress and should aim to maintain or even improve on this going forward. Unfortunately, she missed the previous mock exams."
Green,"There is a mixed picture here in the Literature module for you. While your engagement in class has paid off and you have a very good mark for the assignment, there are distinct areas for improvement. Your webcam has taken a long time for you to fix and your assignment mark could have been better as you are undoubtedly a very promising student, and we will discuss strategies for this in your tutorial. However, there is good work for you to build on and you should aim to base your work in the New Year on this."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated, particularly because of your occasional struggles with Internet connectivity, travelling and time zone differences. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  Your formative assessment showed creativity and ingenuity. You are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Green,"Martina has had many issues with her attendance for multiple reasons. She perhaps needs to improve on her determination and motivation in studying as she has the capabilities to achieve a lot, and I do not understand why she does not apply herself in her studying. Her formative assignment was very good but given her English proficiency and ability to express herself, she can do much better than this. Another thing she can improve on is her participation in class."

It is obvious that she puts considerable effort into her studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. Her knowledge of the topics is reflected in his performance in exams. Martina also has a very good level of understanding, particularly in seminar discussion skills"
Green,"From the start of the course, you have shown yourself to be a committed student in Literature, not only taking an active part in class discussions, but also asking perceptive questions, which has been a delight. This has translated into strong written work, to which you have shown similar dedication. This stands you in good stead for your final summative assignment, and we will discuss strategies for you to build on the work you did in your formative when we meet for your tutorial. All in all, you should be pleased with the work you have done in Literature."
Green,"You have had a very good term in film & media, backed up by your very good grades in S1 and F2. In class, you are consistently making insightful and thought-provoking contributions to discussions, which has been great to see. I now recommend you use the break to plan and prepare your final S2 portfolio. By continuing to show the same level of motivation and hard work, you certainly can achieve an even higher grader for your final summative. Overall, you can be very pleased with your efforts this term, so please keep it up."
Green,"You have had a very good term, showcasing impressive ability, dedication, time management, and consistently great contributions in class. Even more impressive is that this came on the back of a rather disappointing Summative 1 grade. You can be proud of the way you bounced back from that disappointment.  All in all, your performance this term shows great promise for the final summative, so please keep up the fantastic work, and you can be very proud of a great term."

You have tried hard to communicate your ideas in the seminar discussions and you have completed a good amount of activities on the AES platform. I think your confidence has grown throughout the term. The area most in need of improvement seem to be listening, so find a way that suits you to build up this skill whenever you can, including attending the listening workshop."
Green,Siecheng did not achieve as highly as expected with 58% in formative 1.  However I am sure this grade will be improved upon as the language of Decision Maths becomes more understood.  Siecheng engages fully with all synchronous and asynchronous activities and is an active participant in group work.
Green,"A well-motivated student who is always on time for his lessons and his attendance is impeccable along with engagement. He contributes well to the class discussions and always speaks his mind. Accordingly, he sought help on capacitors topic again from me, during the revision week, as he felt he did not fully understand the topic first. He would certainly benefit from additional sessions on his EAL. His attainment levels are very good. He will definitely progress to his higher studies of choice and become an excellent engineer as he has the ability, capacity and flair to be one. Keep up the good work."

Green,"Sicheng is responsive to feedback and builds positive relationships with his peers and tutors. The student participates well in class discussions and makes frequent contributions. Sicheng has made some noticeable progress in terms of his academic speaking (64%) and writing skills (58%). However, the student should continue to work on improving his academic reading and research skills throughout term 3 with the use of Mock Exams as well as independent study tasks available on the AES Online platform every week."
Green,"Sicheng has consistently engaged with the course and tasks.  He will therefore be a little disappointed with his summative 1 grade.  Understanding the requirements of the questions is part of the problem but in addition, it is essential to write out the steps towards the answer.  Sicheng needs to discuss his method and then write it down fully step by step on a sheet other than the question paper.  Maths is not just about finding an answer but also demonstrating how that answer is achieved.

Sicheng now needs to confirm his project title for summative 2 and should concentrate on the topics we have covered in class."
Green,"Your attendance for physics is very good. You always participates in class discussions and solve the questions given by the tutor. Your F2 is 57% and  based on your work, I am sure you could achieve higher grades. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle."
Green,"Your attendance for pure maths is very good. You always participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by the tutor. Your F2 is 73%. Well done! Although based on your work, I am sure you could achieve even higher grades. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for S2 and attend maths workshops to be ready for the S2."

Green,Zhanna is a very good student who is making very good progress. She is attentive and focussed in class. Zhanna often makes contributions to class discussions and these contributions demonstrate very good understanding of the topic. She is often able to answer questions and her answers have good depth of insight. Her formative mark was very good and I am very optimistic about Zhanna's future success in her academic career.
Green,"90% in F1, good work! This student always works hard in class and engages in moodle.Please review solving inequalities, and remember to check work for errors."
Green,"You are a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest in the class (engaging positively in group discussions) and demonstrate a sound command of the subject. You have strong potential to progress, and this is most clearly evidenced by your recent formative assessment score (64%).  Your performance is good but could be stronger and I feel you need to now stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. Improve this by completing all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your success."

Amber,"Zhanna has made some progress over the two terms at RHISC. She shares her ideas during group presentations and is a co-operative, respectful individual. However, her reading and writing skills need further work and improvement as she scores approx. 40% in AES mock exams. Therefore, she must do independent study using resources available on the AES Online platform, complete mock exams and submit the compulsory AES tasks every week. If Zhanna continues to work on her academic skills development in term 3, this should increase her chances of progression to the UG course at RHUL."
Green,"Zhanna remains a very positive, capable and committed student. However, she has shown some reduction of energy and engagement in term 2. Her summative 1 mark was 70 and this is a good reflection of her work in the first part of the course. She will need to continue to work at a high level of energy is she is to achieve her full potential."
Amber,"90% in F1, 92% in S1, 38% in F2. Zhanna had a strong understanding of the topic in Term 1 compared to Term 2. Sometimes her engagement is weaker in class than would be ideal, although she does her best to answer the tutor's questions. She seems confused about her term 2 classes, so it is vital that she works hard to revise the term 2 material over Easter as well as attending support workshops."
Green,"Zhanna - You are a pleasure to teach and show engagement in class, which is very good. You also demonstrate a good command of the subject.  This is clear from your most recent summative 1 score (62%). Improve your score now by completing all the asynchronous actives on Moodle and utilise more key terms in your answers."

She does not often contribute unprompted to class discussion and I would encourage her to be more active in class, answering questions and contributing to discussions. Her formative result was very good and I am very optimistic about Panchaya's future success in her academic career."
Green,"76% in F1. Well done! This is much better than diagnostic test. Overall, this student has a good understanding of the material. She has been attending workshops and it would appear has benefited from them. I am pleased with the progress. Please review percentages, factor theorem and solving inequalities."
Green,"You are a pleasure to teach. You show strong interest in classwork and participate in all group discussions. I was also very pleased with your formative 1 assessment score (70%).

Panchaya is well on her way to passing the IFY programme and achieving the grades needed for progression to her UG course at RHUL."
Green,Panchaya remains a serious and committed student. Whilst she is somewhat quiet in class when she is asked a question she is very capable of answering with insight. Her summative 1 result was good (70) and this bodes well for her progression at the end of the course. Going forward Panchaya needs to maintain consistent levels of energy and engagement in order to succeed.

Green,"I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Fairly active during the class. You have failed to submit some of your assignments. Your mark for summative assessment  2 is also a little concerning when compared to summative 1, and shows that you may not have been working hard enough since summative 1. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to be even more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I want you to make sure that you will not miss any other assignment/quiz."
Green,I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Active during the class and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Your mark for summative assessments 1 is also satisfactory. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to be even more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I also recommend you to practice maths by solving multiple examples and exercises from the slides and the textbook. I also want you to be serious about your assignments and quizzes.

Green,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

Amber,"Haithem is a good student and has a positive attitude when attending the sessions. Although he managed to score 86% in SA1, he needs to be more consistent with his participation and attendance. As we are just over halfway through the module, the content is now becoming even more challenging and advance. He needs to put in effort in order to successfully complete the course."
Green,"You have made good progress, well done!! You will progress faster by spending more time studying, including going over the materials on Moodle, revising what you have learnt, working on the exercises and practise coding with Java. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

Green,"Good job, you have done well so far in the module. 
You have demonstrated a good level of engagement with class activities and you have done well in the first summative assessment.  Please make every effort to attend all remaining sessions and engage with the class activities. I like to hear more from you in group conversations and Padlet summaries. Keep up the hard work and aim to complete the recommended reading tasks from the textbook to maintain your level of performance."

Green,"Ali Ahmed attends the live sessions regularly and is usually an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions. It is obvious that he puts a very good level of effort into his work. He has also met the majority of deadlines set but could be more consistent. Since the beginning of the term he has shown a very good knowledge of the topics, which could yet be further broadened by revising the materials on Insendi. His results in assessments have generally been good but he needs to improve his writing skills."
Amber,"Ali is generally a good student He makes good contributions in class although at times he can become a little distracted. His contributions in class show very good thinking and insight to the subject. However, he needs to be careful of assuming too much knowledge and take the time to listen and learn about new ideas and concepts.
His formative was good, but perhaps a little below the standard that I am sure he is capable of. By listening to the feedback I am confident that Ali will develop very well and continue to succeed on the course."
Amber,"Ali - You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate some command of the subject and this is clear from your most recent formative assessment score, which was 58%. You do need to put in more effort though, in order to succeed and you do need to stretch yourself further. Improve your performance by following all the asynchronous actives on Moodle and memorise the glossary from the text. This should help you improve your scores further."
Amber,Ali has made a good progress since the beginning of the term. His class contributions are becoming more nuanced and show an improvement in his subject-related analytical skills. He always submits his work on time and shows a lot of interest in the topics we discuss. The Formative 1 submission was brought down primarily by English. He will need to devote a lot of time over the next months to improve his Academic English. I was pleased to hear that he has already started attending the AES writing workshop.

Green,"Ali Ahmed has attended most of the classes. During the live sessions he demonstrates that he has good ideas, which he usually expresses in group works. However, he should try to participate more in whole class discussions.  It is obvious that he puts considerable effort into his studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. His results in assessments have generally been good but he needs to improve his writing skills."
Green,Ali has had a good year so far and is a very talented student. He is able to contribute competently to class discussions and is often prepared to try answer questions that he is not 100% sure of. His summative 1 mark was very good and this is a good reflection of his capabilities. Going forward Ali needs to maintain and develop his positive attitude towards learning to get the most from his studies.
Green,"Ali  - You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate command of the subject and this is clear from your most recent summative assessment score, which was 68%. You can improve further by completing all the asynchronous activities on Moodle and increasing the use of subject-specific terminology in your assessments."
Amber,"Ali's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 has shown a good improvement in terms of writing, analytical and research skills. However, his engagement with the course this term has been rather patchy. Even though his contributions to the class discussions were valuable and often very insightful, he missed a few assignment submissions and some of them were rather poor. I recommend that he allocates some time during the spring break to catch up with the readings and to start revising for the Summative Assessment 2."

It is obvious that he puts considerable effort into his studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. His knowledge of the topics is reflected in his performance in exams. Muneeb also has a very good level of understanding, particularly in seminar discussion skills."
Green,Muneeb is a very bright and active student. He is often at the forefront of contributing to class discussions and his contributions often demonstrate a good understanding of the topic being discussed. Whilst there are times when Muneeb's understanding can improve he is always open to new information and learning which is a very important skill for success. Muneeb did a good formative and I am optimistic that his work will improve as he develops during the year.
Green,"68% in F1. This student is very engaged in class. He is very diligent. In the future, please make sure you review all class notes carefully and ask me for clarification if you have any questions. This student always asks questions in class and engaged well and does his homework, good job!"
Amber,"You are a pleasure to teach and show engagement in class, which is very good. You also demonstrate a sound command of the subject and this is clear from your most recent formative assessment score, which was 58%.

Amber,Muneeb is usually an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions.  He is a conscientious student. It is obvious that he puts considerable effort into his studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. She consistently does her homework and submits on time. We observe that his knowledge base comes through clearly in practical tasks and he can readily apply this in both class and assessment tasks. He should practise his listening skills over the break.
Green,"Muneeb has a great deal of talent and is capable of being very successful in his studies. However, he has shown a little reduction of energy and engagement in term 2. In some way, this is understandable, but he now needs to commit himself to energising his studies if he is going to achieve his full potential. It was notable that his summative 2 resit was significantly better than the original work which indicates his lack of application on the first attempt."
Green,"68% in F1, 80% in F2, 52% in S1. This is a student who has good skills in mathematics who ensures that he works on his future time management (to give plenty of time for assignment submission) and engagement in class as he can be quieter during group activities."
Green,"Muneeb - You are a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest in class, get involved in group discussions, and demonstrate a sound command of the subject. You have strong potential to progress, and this is most clearly evidenced by your recent summative assessment score (70%).  To go even further, ensure you complete all the asynchronous actives on Moodle, memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook (in order to include more key terms in your assessments) and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your success."

Green,"From the start of the term, you have displayed an impressive commitment to your studies. This has paid off for your assignment mark which was richly deserved - well done. You have worked hard to engage both in groups and in class and this has been good to see. We will discuss strategies to improve your assignments still further in your tutorial - as this is something of which you are undoubtedly capable. Moreover, when you have the time, you should think of engaging with the additional materials connected to the texts on Moodle."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  You received a very good grade for your excellent formative assessment, which was a fascinating, personal response to the brief. You also had excellent attendance, and you are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Amber,"Sara's attendance record has been excellent. She consistently participates actively in class and makes valuable contributions. She is a conscientious student and seems to put a lot of effort in her studies. While she did good in her Formative Assignment, I believe she is able to perform much better than this.

You have been rewarded with an excellent mark for your Summative 1 in particular. We will discuss strategies for building on your Formative 2, which was not as strong though still very good, when we meet for your tutorial. All in all, you should be very pleased with your work in Literature."
Green,"You have had a very good term in film & media, showing diligence, motivation and dedication. This has paid off with an excellent F2 score that holds a lot of promise for your written components of the final S2 portfolio.

Overall, you should be very proud of all your hard work and effort this term, so please keep it up."
Green,"You have had a very good term, working very hard and remaining conscientious and motivated. In class, you regularly contribute very well and ask excellent questions, which is always great to see. Your grades have been improving and I have every belief that with all your hard work and dedication, you will continue to improve again for the final summative. Remember to use the Spring break as a chance to revise and refresh your memory of the material, which will continue to enhance your sociological knowledge for your written assessments. Overall, you have worked very hard this term and should be proud of your work, please keep it up."

It is obvious that he is making very good progress. This term, Alwalid has shown a very good knowledge of the topics, which could yet be further broadened by revising the materials on Insendi. Regarding his assessments, while he is very good at the reading component, he needs to improve his listening skills and increase his score."
Amber,"Alwalid is a good student. He takes his studies seriously and is very focussed in class. He often makes contributions to class discussions and is able to answer questions when asked. 

His formative result was a little disappointing, but I am confident that if he takes time to reflect on the feedback and continues to work as he has been doing then he will be a very successful student on this course."
Green,"Alwalid - You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate some command of the subject and this is clear from your most recent formative assessment score, which was 58%.

Amber,"Alwalid has made a good progress since the start of the term. The subject-related knowledge and analytical skills have improved considerably and his class contributions have become more insightful. He is very conscientious, allocates time for independent study and completes the activities on time.

It is obvious that he puts a good level of effort into his work. If he can sustain or improve this, it will be a factor in his success. He is making good progress and should aim to maintain or even improve on this going forward. His performance in exams is satisfactory, but should improve his listening skills."
Green,Alwalid is a very capable student who participates well in class. He is able to address questions competently and is able to ask questions when needs support. His summative 1 mark was very good and reflects his efforts to succeed on the course. Going forward he should maintain his very good level of consistency and commitment that he has shown during the first part of the course.
Green,"Alwalid - Teaching you is a pleasure. You demonstrate a good command of the subject which is clear from your most recent summative assessment score (75%). You show a good interest in class, respond to questions when asked and are proactive in taking part in group discussions. You also show a good grasp of subject-specific terms which is clear in your written work. Moving forward, complete your forum questions punctually and engage in more independent reading."
Amber,"Al Walid's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 showed a good improvement in terms of analytical and research skills. His writing, however, needs further improvement. Al Walid remains very conscientious and hardworking. His assignments were submitted on time this term, and he strives to produce high quality work. I appreciate his contributions to the class discussions which are insightful and stimulating. I recommend that he allocates time during the spring break to start revising for the Summative Assessment 2 and to practice short essay writing."

Amber,"Nada is a very good student who works well in class. At times she finds it hard to answer questions when asked in class, but overall her attitude to learning is very positive.

Her formative result is a little below where I would like Nada to be, but she has listened carefully to the feedback and I believe that she has the capability to develop herself going forward."

Green,I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Active during the class and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Your marks for summative assessments 1 and  2 are also satisfactory and shows that you have been working hard. Please keep up the good work. I would like you to do more practice by solving different examples. Try to complete all exercises in our slides which will help you to do even better in your next assessments.
Green,"I am generally happy with your progress in this module. Good attendance record. Active during the class and submitted the quizzes and assignments. Although, your mark for summative assessments 1 is a little concerning. I would like you to be even more active during the sessions and get involved in the class discussions. I also recommend you to practice maths by solving multiple examples and exercises from the slides and the textbook. I believe more practice is going to help you perform better in your next assessments."
Amber,"Ahmed has a positive attitude towards computing, but he should practice more. Areas that need extra attention are outlining the problem: try planing your code away from the computer — it will help you build a clear mental model before you start. And, be sceptic: constantly check to make sure that your code actually is doing what you think it should be doing. This means you take a few minutes to double and triple check before moving on to the next thing. Before seeking any help, try firstly to find the answer by yourself: push yourself a bit. This will help to develop your skills further and get to where you want to go."
Amber,"The comments given to this student for their OOP1 module stand true for this module too. My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

Amber,"You have made an excellent start in class in this module. Your contributions are meaningful, apposite and generally well-considered. You work well in groups, though you have an occasional tendency to become distracted, so you should keep an eye on this. Unfortunately your assignment has not reflected your level of classroom achievement, which is the reason for your amber rating. We will discuss the reasons for this mark - and strategies to improve for your summative - in your tutorial. You are clearly capable of this, but this is a hurdle you need to overcome in order to achieve and it is where you need to focus your attention in the New Year."

Green,"Michael is a very interesting case. His attendance record is excellent while his participation in class is excellent. Despite this, his Formative assignment was only good, and he failed to attain a progression mark. I do believe that he can improve a lot on this, but he needs to apply himself more in his learning and studying.

Green,"From the start, you have been keen to contribute in Literature. You have worked hard in class, both in class discussions and in groups. After a somewhat rocky start with assignments, you have done rather better, though it would be good to see you build on that success further with your final summative work, and we will discuss strategies for that in your tutorial and in class. Overall, you should be pleased with the work you have done for this module."
Amber,"Overall you have had a good term, always contributing excellently in class, but this is amber because your F2 and S1 resit scores were slightly low. It does seem like the pile-up of assessments, as well as the fact you were forced to miss a few classes, meant you were not in the best circumstances to achieve the best assessments. Therefore, I really hope you can make use of the break to use the time and plan/prepare in advance for your S2 portfolio. With good time management, effort and motivation, you certainly have the capabilities to lift your overall grade up with an excellet S2 performance."
Green,"You have had a good term, and demonstrated an excellent willingness to learn and participate in class discussions, so please keep this up. Your summative 1 grade was good, but hopefully with a bit more time and practice, you can do even better for your final summative. Try to make use of the break to keep revising the concepts from the module, and to work on the mini-essay homework. This will then put you in a great position to write a strong essay for the final summative. Overall, though, you can be very proud of your efforts this term and please keep up the great work."

Green,"Anand engages fully with all activities and questions anything he does not understand.  Anand achieved an excellent 90% in formative 1 and will, I am sure, demonstrate the same level throughout the course.  His commitment to his studies is commendable."
Green,"A very Engaging student with a curious scientific mind, who constantly strives to understand every little detail in Physics. Well done on this. He is very vocal in the class, which shows his enthusiasm for the subject, however he would benefit from taking his turn and putting his hands up rather than quickly intervening in the conversations, which might be misconstrued and talking over the others. He is a popular member of the cohort with apparent leadership qualities. He can benefit from shedding some misconceptions in Physics he may have developed during his high school studies. His attainment levels are very good in my assessments and I wish him well in his future studies."

He has made noticeable progress in terms of his reading and research skills, as demonstrated in CW1. Anand should continue to work on improving his writing and academic seminar discussion skills throughout term 3 with the use of Mock Exams as well as independent study tasks available on the AES Online platform every week."
Green,"Anand will be disappointed by his grade in summative 1 although, apart from confusing two concepts, most errors are about following the correct processes.  He is far more mathematically capable than the assessment mark would indicate.  

Anand is very confident and asks questions when he needs clarification.  However, he needs to understand when it is appropriate to speak out and use the tools we have to indicate he has a question.  

I have no doubt that Anand will do well in his future learning and career."
Green,"Your attendance for physics is very good. You always participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by the tutor. Your F2 is 77%. Well done! Although based on your work, I am sure you could achieve even higher grades. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle."
Green,"Your attendance for pure maths is very good. You always participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by the tutor. Your F2 is 74%. Well done! Although based on your work, I am sure you could achieve even higher grades. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for S2 and attend maths workshops to be ready for the S2."

Amber,"Octavio demonstrates a good learning attitude and homework completion. He contributes actively, when present, to all class discussions. However, he has scored below the 60% requirement for the IFY course overall in his listening, reading and writing assessment to date. Given the high entry requirements from RHUL for arts, he needs to improve his reading and writing skills. Attending listening and writing workshops is recommended. Doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to him on the AES platform is likely to improve chances of progression."
Green,"You have made a very good start in the Literature module - well done. Your contributions in class are apposite and thoughtful, showing that you engage with the materials, and that you are thinking about what we are learning at a meaningful level. You also work well in groups, all of which fosters an attitude which will enable you to do well on the course. This has been borne out by your assignment mark, which was well-deserved. In the New Year you should think about engaging with the further materials on Moodle so that you can work more on developing a still deeper understanding of the texts we are studying: you will find this rewarding and helpful."
Green,"You have made a very good start in Music. Your commitment, from the start of the year, has been evident - including the time difference! You have been careful to do the work set and participate meaningfully in class, asking questions and answering them thoughtfully. This has all paid off in a very good assignment mark, though there is clear capacity to push that up further - and we will discuss this in your tutorial. However, you have laid very solid foundations on which to build and you should aim to keep this up next term."
Amber,"Octavio has an excellent attendance record. He is often quite talkative during class, and he contributes in our discussions. I believe also that he is a conscientious student; while his Formative assignment was good, I think he is able to achieve much more than this and go towards an easy progression mark. Similar to the majority of the cohort, he had issues with secondary literature. I am confident that he will be able to achieve a progression mark if he follows the feedback and feedforward from the assignment."

Amber,"The learning attitude and progress being made in AES course by Octavio was impressive. He tends to be participating actively in lesson discussions and he shows good understanding of the concepts introduced so far this term. He has also completed his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a high completion rate. His writing skills, however, need further development. Attending writing workshops and doing independent study over the winter break using resources available to him on Moodle is likely to improve chances of progression. He is also advised to hand all of his homework in on time and to a high standard."
Green,"You have shown yourself to be both perceptive and dedicated as a student in Literature. Your contributions to class are apposite and intelligent, as are your well-placed questions. You also work well in groups. All of this has contributed to a series of excellent assignment marks, each building on the last. This places you in a very strong position for your final assignment. Overall, you should be very pleased indeed with your work in the Literature course this year."
Green,"You work in Music has been excellent, particularly on the more theoretical side, where you have freely owned a new world has been opened up to you. Your consistent interest in following this up with additional listening has meant that you are now able to discuss music in class authoritatively which is impressive, so well done. Your Summative 1 displayed the results of this. Your Formative 2 gave you some distinct areas upon which to work for Summative 2, but your attitude to the course stands you in good stead and you are on track to progress."
Green,"Overall, you have had a very good term in sociology, demonstrating hard work, a desire to learn, and great dedication. In class, you contribute really well, and demonstrate plenty of critical thinking with your questions and comments. Your summative 1 and formative 2 grades were both good, but we have spoken about how you can make your essays more focused and coherent. Try to take this feedback on board for when you work on your final summative. With your level of understanding and thinking ability, you are more than able to keep doing even better. Just please remain motivated and keep up the great work."
Amber,"Octavio shows good learning attitudes and actively contributes to all class discussions. He has made satisfactory progress so far this term. He has also completed his AES asynchronous tasks on time and with a good completion rate. His writing skills, however, need further development. I advise him to find the confidence to contribute more regularly, since putting forward ideas in group discussions will enhance his critical thinking skills. Attending writing workshops and drop-in sessions, doing extensive writing exercises and doing independent learning materials are likely to improve chances of progression."

She is also a conscientious student, which is reflected in her performance in assessments. Her previous mock exam results are really good, except writing. Therefore she can revise the features of academic writing during winter break. Sje can refer to the materials on Insendi"
Green,"You have made an excellent start to the year's work, showing yourself to be a committed and engaged student. You perform very well in group work and are always ready to contribute to class discussions. You have reaped the rewards of this in an excellent formative assignment result - well done. In order to continue this, you should continue to work hard for this module, engaging with the texts - and try challenging yourself with the additional materials on Moodle adding to your depth of understanding of the class material."
Green,Kashish has been a very engaged student. She is conscientious and invests time to complete the class and home activities. Her class contributions show very good analytical abilities and a good progress regarding the subject-specific knowledge. The grade for Formative 1 reflects well her skills and abilities.
Green,"Kashish's attendance has been excellent. She consistently participates and makes valuable contributions in class. She seems to be a conscientious student, reflected in her contributions in class and assessments. Her formative assessment was very good but I believe she can do much better than what she got. She needs to continue with similar engagement and determination, and this will guarantee her a progression at RH."

Green,"Kashish is usually an active participant in class discussions and asks useful questions. It is also obvious that she puts considerable effort into her studies and is encouraged to keep up the good work. Her adherence to deadlines is very good and sets a firm foundation for success. Overall, Kashish is making very good progress."
Green,"You are a committed and engaged student, which you have shown right from the beginning of the course. This is evident in your classwork which is excellent at every level and in your assignments. I know that it is difficult that your Formative 2 was less successful than your Summative 1 but we will discuss the reasons for that in your upcoming tutorial and see what you need to do in order to improve for Summative 2. If you carry on working hard, you should be able to do well."
Green,"Kashish's Resit of the Summative Assessment 1 has shown an impressive improvement in terms of knowledge and understanding, quality of writing and research and analytical skills. Her engagement with the course has been continuous and she has always submitted her homework and asynchronous activities on time. Her class intervention have been stimulating and have shown a very good ability to apply the conceptual and theoretical framework to the case-studies discussed. I recommend that she keeps up the very good work so far."
Green,"You have had a very good term, showcasing impressive ability, very good contributions in class, and an excellent aptitude for writing essays. All this is highly positive and shows your talent as a student. However, I also feel at times you could engage more with the homework and asynchronous activities, in order to be sure you keep on top of all the material from the module. This will ensure your grades remain at a high standard, by firmly rooting your assignments in sociological perspectives. Please feel free to reach out to me if you ever have any questions about this material or want recommendations for further reading. Overall, though, the level of your assignments both summative and formative has been excellent, and you can be very proud of a great term. Please keep up the great work."

Amber,"Overall, Talal, has performed reasonably well in his first set of mock exams, and reached his progression of 50% in each of the skills. He possesses strong speaking skills and based on his class performance I believe he is capable of achieving higher grades in the upcoming summative exams. I strongly recommend that Talal should take advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare, and seek further support from her AES tutor."
Amber,Talal is a positive student who engages well in class. He is generally confident enough to answer questions asked in class although sometimes his answers may show some lack of understanding. I am confident that Talal will be successful this year as long as he is committed and works on the feedback that he receives.
Amber,"You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate some command of the subject. It is clear from your most recent formative assessment score that is  56%. You do need to put in more effort though, to succeed and you do need to stretch yourself further. Improve your performance by following all the asynchronous actives on Moodle and memorise the glossary from the text. This should help you improve your scores further."
Green,"Talal makes valuable contributions in class and his written work shows much promise. I have no doubt that he fully understand the concepts in the module. To continue to make progress, Talal needs to engage in reading and ensure that his written work is supported by appropriate academic sources."
Amber,"Talal’s summative exams have shown that his listening and speaking to be his strongest language skills. However, his exam reading skills and CW1 assessment are areas that require strengthening as he did not achieve a pass/ progression grade. Thus, to help him prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing exam booklet as a resource that will best help him reach progression. In addition, he should focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result. He should also resubmit CW1 during the resit period to help boost his chances of progression."
Amber,"Talal remains a student with a great deal of talent, but his attendance is a little inconsistent. When in class he is able to answer questions with some degree of success and he shows good understanding in general. His summative 1 result was reasonably good, but he did not submit a formative for his second assignment so feedback is difficult. There are very few classes left before the final assignment and Talal needs to attend these as it will make a big difference to his chances of success."
Amber,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance. I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to succeed."
Amber,"Although your Summative 1 result was good, this is Amber mainly because you have not been able to complete Formative 2. This therefore leaves me slightly worried as you have not had the chance to practice writing a sociology essay, and I cannot assess your level of essay-writing nor give you any feedback/feedforward. Please make sure to make the most of the time you have left and try to send me a draft in time for our individual tutorial next week."

Amber,"Yousef appears to be a good student. His attendance is good and his engagement in class is good. He makes contributions to class discussions and will often attempt to answer more challenging questions. His understanding of the topics is not always complete, but he is showing very good attitude to learning and I am confident of his ability to develop during the course."
Amber,You are a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest in the class. You proactively participate and demonstrate a command of the subject.  You do need to stretch yourself further by completing all the asynchronous actives on Moodle. Memorise the glossary from the Kortext textbook. Do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your success.
Amber,"This student has provided insightful comments in the lessons and completed all homework on time. Overall, this student has done well in the first 5 weeks of term 1. In the future, this student needs to ensure that he gains further understanding about how to evaluate in essays, as this will be useful for F1/S1 examinations.."
Amber,"You are participating well in all your live sessions and are a pleasure to have in the class. Continue to show the same enthusiasm and commitment moving forwards to get a good AES grade. Your participation in AES Online tasks has been very good, and I hope that you feel you are benefitting from this. Keep up the good work. One area to work on is speaking in the seminar. Make sure you are participating actively and using some language and techniques covered on AES Online and in-class to structure and extend your contributions. Participating in the weekly Flipgrid tasks will also help you build confidence."
Amber,"Yousef remains a good student. His engagment is generally good although I notice that he is a little quieter lately which may indicate a reduction of energy as the course progresses. His formative 1 result was good, but not quite at the standard required for progression so Yousef needs to maintain high levels of energy going forward going forward if he is to succeed. However, I remain confident about his success overall this year."
Green,"You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate some command of the subject. It is clear from your most recent formative-1 assessment score is 60 %. A lot of effort is needed to attain success need to stretch yourself further. Improve your performance by following all the asynchronous actives on Moodle and memorise the glossary from the tex, this should help you ensure improve scores required for progression."
Amber,"57% essay in F1. Good start but needs to review notes about how to evaluate theories. Also, whilst he is able to answer some questions in class, he should review his past notes in order to jog his memory. Also, it is recommended to practice essay writing."
Green,"You have made noticeable progress in terms of your reading and research skills, as demonstrated in CW1 where you were awarded a mark of 72%. As part of a group, you make group collaboration straightforward as you offer constructive suggestions to peers to enhance their performance. Not only that, but you also accept the recommendations of your peers and act on feedback when appropriate, always searching for ways to improve. You achieved high scores in the Summative Exams (87.5% in Listening; 85% in Reading and 70% in Writing as well as 72% in Speaking Assessment). I would like to congratulate you on your achievements so far and encourage you to continue in this positive, responsible manner throughout Term 3. Yousef, you are well on your way to achieving the marks needed for progression to your UG course at Royal Holloway."
Amber,"Yousef is a good student who clearly has a great deal of talent which he has the opportunity to develop further. His summative 1 result was very good, which reflects his good understanding of the topics. His engagement in class is generally good and he is very capable of answering questions well in class when asked. His formative 2 assignment was not quite at the level required for progression, but it shows a great deal of promise and the feedback will help him to improve. Overall, as long as he maintains his commitment Yousef should be able to complete the course successfully."
Green,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance, but I can stress that having a green colour for the last RPAG means that you are doing well, so keep up the good work. I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to exceed and succeed."
Green,"S1 essay was a big improvement from F1 grade. Good job. Also, for F2, you got 73%, this is great.

This student has occasional lapses in attention, but generally works hard."

Amber,"Jiahan’s has performed reasonably in her first set of mock exams, and reached her progression of 50% in each of the skills. In order to achieve overall progression of 60% she needs to further work on all skills for the coming summative exams. I strongly recommend that Jiahan should take advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare, and seek further support from her AES tutor. Jiahan is one of the quieter students in class but she should try to take a more active part in discussions as she had some interesting ideas to share."
Amber,"Jiahan is a very good student who appears to be engaged in class and confident. However, she is often a little quiet and I would like to see this improve going forward in order for her to get the most out of classes. Her formative result was quite close to the standard required so I am optimistic that as she develops going forward she will be able to succeed this year."
Green,"82% in F1, good work! In class, Rachel is sometimes confused about addition/subtraction/multiplation/division so it might be useful for her to attend workshops to look at simple maths first. However, she is able to understand more complex processes. She needs to revise the factor theorem."
Amber,"You are a pleasure to teach. You demonstrate some command of the subject. It is clear from your most recent formative-1 assessment score is 56%. A lot of effort is needed to attain success need to stretch yourself further. Improve your performance by following all the asynchronous actives on Moodle and memorise the glossary from the tex, this should help you ensure improve scores required for progression."
Amber,"Jiahan’s summative results overall shows that more time should be dedicated to her English studies if she is to achieve progression. Speaking and reading are her stronger skills, but failed to reach a pass mark for her writing exam. To help her prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help her to pass the exams. In addition, she should also focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve her end goal, and perhaps consider resubmitting her CW1 in the resit period."
Green,"Jiahan is a very good student. She is very capable of answering questions in class and when she does she shows very good understanding. This good understanding has transferred to her results so although her summative 1 result was disappointing she has done a very good assignment for formative 2 which is much more demanding piece of work. Her summative 1 resit has not been marked yet, but I am hopeful that this mark will be much improved."
Amber,"This student understands higher level maths but needs to focus on checking her work to avoid making mistakes in simple addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Overall, very good hard working student. 74% in S1, good work.
However, this student failed F2 so will need to attend tutorials and workshops before S2 exam."

He achieved over 60% in his listening, reading, writing and speaking and I hope that for the upcoming summative exams he will be able to achieve similar results if not higher. I strongly recommend that Zhilin take advantage of the reading and writing, and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform as a way to continue his exam preparation."
Green,"Zhilin is a very capable student who is engaged and shows good interest in the subject. His formative 1 result was good albeit he submitted his work late and so received a ten mark penalty. Without this penalty his mark would be at the required standard to progress and Zhilin should continue to work at this standard for achieve success this year, which I feel confident he will."
Green,90% in F1. Good work! Improvement since Amber was given last time in terms of understanding the work more and engagement. Very good at asking questions in the lesson. Please make sure you practice the factor theorem.
Green,"You are a pleasure to teach. You show significant interest during class time and demonstrate a sound knowledge of the subject. Your recent summative assessment score is 65%.  You have strong potential to increase your score further, as evidenced by your performance in your assessment. However, you need to answer forum questions on time and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your progression."
Green,"Zhilin has worked hard this year and his results are reflective of this as his summative results show that he has met progression. To further improve upon these grades I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help him improve. In addition, he should also focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve his end goal."
Green,"Zhilin remains a very good student. However, there is a slight reduction in his engagement in class over the last few weeks. This may just be the natural effect of the year of work. His summative 1 mark was a little disappointing, but I am hopeful that the resit will be much better. He has submitted a very good formative 2 (a much more challenging piece of work). Overall Zhilin is a student with a great deal of talent and if he continues to accept the guidance and feedback I am optimistic about his prospects of success this year."

She achieved over 60% in her listening, reading, and speaking and I hope that for the upcoming summative exams she will be able to achieve similar results if not higher. She has already taken the initiative to seek help with her writing as she scored just below 60%. In addition, I strongly recommend that Varanya take advantage of the reading and writing, and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform as a way to continue her exam preparation."
Green,Varanya is a very good student who is engaged in class and often participates in class discussions. Her formative 1 assignment was very good and she should continue to work at this level going forward. I am very optimistic that Varanya will have a very successful year ahead of her.
Green,"You are a good student, however, your concentration level in class is lower than before. It is evidenced by your recent summative assessment score (65%). You have the potential to progress, although you do need to stretch yourself further to meet your progression requirements. Do complete all the asynchronous activities on Moodle. Memorising the glossary from the Kortext textbook will help you do this. Do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your progression."
Amber,"Varanya's submission for the Formative Assessment 1, as well as her class engagement and homework submissions, have shown good knowledge and understanding of the content covered so far and improving research and writing skills. She is very conscientious, hardworking and always on time with her submissions. I appreciate her class contributions which I find insightful and valuable and the positive energy she brings to this class. She needs some help to improve her academic writing skills and she has already sought support from her AES tutor."
Green,"Varanya has been working diligently throughout the year, and it has truly paid off as her summative results show that she has met progression. One area that could still be improved upon is her exam reading skills as she scored below 60%. To help her prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing booklet as a resource that will best help her improve. In addition, she should also focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve her end goal."
Green,"Varanya is a very good student. She is very able to answer questions in class and these answers generally show good understanding of the topic. Her work is of a very high standard and in particular her formative 2 assignment was very good. Notably, she also sought out an additional tutorial for summative 2 to clarify some points and this demonstrates her motivation and commitment to her studies. I am very optimistic about Varanya's academic career and she is llikely to be very successful going forward."
Green,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance. However, I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to succeed."

Written communication has also improved a lot.Unfortunately, over the last weeks Varanya has appeared to be rather overwhelmed by the number of assessments and have fallen behind with the required weekly preparation for this course. I recommend that now she focuses exclusively on the final assessments and allocates as much time as it is needed to complete them."

His understanding appears to be developing well, but I would like to see him participate a little more in class discussions to help him progress."

He needs to work on listening to instructions and writing out answers to problems step by step, as in Summative examples, marks will be awarded for both the calculation steps and the correct answer. Also please revise factor theorem."

In addition, he should also focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve his end goal."
Amber,"Abdulrahman remains a little bit distant in class. He does not turn on his camera and only contributes to class discussions via the 'chat' box in class which is quite unusual. However his answers and questions often show good understanding and I believe that he has some good capability that he has the opportunity to develop. His summative 1 result was acceptable, but he did not submit an assignment for formative 2 and this is concerning. In order to complete the course successfully he needs to energise himself and commit to some hard work before the end of the term."
Amber,"This student understands the subject very well and works hard. However, there are occasional lapses in attention. 82% in S1, well done!

It is essential that she focuses on preparation before the seminar in order to feel more confident during the seminars, which in turn will improve her results in the next assessment. Although the scores achieved already would probably be high enough for progression, it is important that she improves this skill in order to be able to fully participate in the sessions when she goes on to her degree."
Green,"I am happy to confirm that Yifan has reflected on feedback from her assessments and in class discussions and she has improved on her Machine Fundamentals module. I like to hear more from her in class about her questions. She should not feel sy to raise her voice and ask questions when she has one. 
Well done, Yifan."
Green,Yifan is an excellent student with a positive attitude towards her studies. She managed to achieve 69% in SA1 but has the potential to achieve more. Yifan needs to work on her vocabulary and use a proactive approach to her studies by going through the lecture notes beforehand. This way she could raise more questions and understand the topics better. She needs to prepare well for the upcoming SA2 and SA3.
Green,"Icey has  been active in class and she has engaged with group discussions, Padlet submissions and quick question-answer activities. She has an outstanding attendance of 100% in her programming classes and this has contributed to boosting her programming skills. She has managed to improve her programming skills and technical English skills. She should feel free to ask questions when she has one and she should not feel shy to get out her comfort zone and ask questions or share and explain her answer to programming questions in order to improve her speaking English using correct technical terminology."

I was pleased with her results in the first exams, but there is definitely still room for improvement in writing. She would benefit from revising some of the work we have done on cohesion in essay writing, and I will provide her with supplementary practice materials."
Green,"Yifan has done well in the S1 (94%). Her attendance is also excellent however, she can improve her participation in class. Overall, she is a good student."
Green,Well done. You have passed the module and met your progression requirements.
Green,Well done on successfully passing the module. Keep up the good work in the next semester.
Green,"You have made an excellent start to the module and you seem to be actively engaged in class. Well done, please continue to work hard and maintain your level of performance. You can practice with examples and exercises from the slides and if you need help, please free to ask for questions in class or bring them to the workshop sessions."
Green,"Well done, You have passed and met your progression requirements. You may wish to review and practice with examples and exercises from IY1_OOP I to improve your performance in IY1_OOP II."
Green,"You have outstanding performance in the module. Well done. You have improved your scores in the summative assessments, and you have a high level of attendance. 
Please continue to maintain your excellent level of performance."

Green,"Michelle has performed very well in her first set of mock exams, particularly in her reading, listening and speaking. I have no doubt that as long as she continues with her current performance she will do well in the upcoming summative exams. Her writing, already very good, is one area that can be further worked on, and one that I believe she can achieve an even higher score in providing she takes on board the feedback and applies it to her writing. I recommend completing 1 or 2 writing exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare and seek feedback from her AES tutor."
Green,"You have made a very good start to the year with the Literature module. You have shown yourself to be a dedicated student, and especially in your tutorials show that you are conscientious and working hard. Moreover, in the tutorials you reveal a depth of understanding which is impressive, and you were rewarded with a very good assignment mark: well done. However, you are very quiet in class - it would be nice to hear a little more from you. This is something for you to work on in the coming weeks. Overall, you should be pleased."
Amber,"Michelle's submission for the Formative Assessment 1, as well as her class engagement and homework submissions, have shown good knowledge and understanding of the content covered so far and improving research and writing skills. She is very conscientious, hardworking and always on time with her submissions. I appreciate her class contributions which I find insightful and valuable."
Green,"Michelle's is a committed student and her work is very promising. Providing that she takes note of her feedback, she will continue to improve.

It would be good if Michelle would contribute more to class discussions. When she does, she always has something interesting to say. 

As is the case with the other students in the group, Michelle needs to become conversant with the Harvard referencing system."
Green,"Michelle possesses strong language skills which she has been able to apply well to the AES exams and coursework. Her results to date are very good to outstanding. She has demonstrated strong critical thinking skills and this will put her in good stead for her university studies. An area that could be improved upon further is her exam writing skills and providing she takes on the feedback I believe that Michelle will be able to do well in the summative exam. I have recommended the reading and writing exam booklet as a resource that will best help her practice. In addition, she should focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result."
Green,"You have worked very hard in this module and this has paid off with strong assignment marks for your Formative 2 and your Summative 1 - well done. This gives you a solid basis from which to work for your Summative 2. In class, it is clear you are listening carefully, and you work well in groups. However, you do not participate much in class discussions, and it would be good to see you develop in this area over the next few weeks, especially as you speak so comfortably in tutorials. Finally, you are very conscientious about asynchronous work. All in all, there is a lot to be pleased with here."
Amber,"Michelle's submissions for the Summative Assessment 1 and Formative Assessment 2 showed good progress in terms of research and analytical skills. She remains very conscientious and the two assessments reflect very well the work she has put in to improve her knowledge, understanding and critical skills. I am confident that if she keeps up the good work she will meet the progression requirements."
Green,"Your Summative 1 result was very good. However, you were not able to complete Formative 2. As you have not had the chance to practice writing a sociology essay,  I cannot assess your level of essay-writing nor give you any feedback/feedforward. I therefore recommend you make sure to make the most of the time you have left and try to send me a draft in time for our individual tutorial."

Green,"Yixi has very good English language skills and this has been reflected in his first set of mock exam results that have been very pleasing. He achieved over 60% in his listening, reading, writing and speaking and I hope that for the upcoming summative exams he will be able to achieve similar results if not higher. I strongly recommend, Yixi, to take advantage of the reading and writing, and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help him further prepare for the exams."
Green,"You have freely admitted to having something of a confidence issue, but we are gradually working around this with the use of the chat box and this is proving a good strategy as you are showing that you are capable of meaningful and apposite contributions in class. This is backed up by the way you work in groups. Moreover, your assignment mark was strong, showing you have a solid foundation for your summative work. All in all, you should be pleased with your term's work in Literature, which shows promise."
Green,"You have had a very good term, showing a good level of knowledge in your formative which was very good, as well as in your homework which was consistently very good. You are clearly a very able student and I believe you can even do better in your summative now that you have had more practice. However, while you clearly do very well during the small group activities, it would be great to see you speak up and contribute more during the class as it seems you are a little bit shy to do so. This would be an excellent skill for you to keep developing, especially for the rest of your academic studies. Remember, that the class is only a small and nice group and everyone is friends, so you should feel free to speak or ask anything at any time!"
Amber,"Yixi is a quiet student but, if asked, always makes an interesting contribution. I would encourage him to participate more fully in class discussions.

Yixi seems to have quite a good grasp of the key concepts and theories, but he needs to work on the organisation and presentation of his written work, ensuring that he always responds directly and clearly to the question.

As is the case for most of the students in his group, Yixi needs to become fully familiar with academic conventions, in particular referencing."
Amber,"Yixi has performed reasonably well in his summative assessments, but still needs to put in more effort to push his grade up further to the 60% and 70% in writing in order to meet progression. To help him prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing, and listening exam booklets as resources that will best help him improve. In addition, he should also focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve his end goal."
Green,"With strong Summative 1 and Formative 2 results you have laid a strong foundation for Summative 2 - well done. This is backed up by hard work both in class and outside it. You engage well in class, both in class discussion and in group work. Moreover, you are clearly doing the asynchronous work set. All of this means that you are in a good place looking ahead to Summative 2. You should aim to keep this up for the final few weeks of the course."
Green,"You have continued to work well this term and been regular in completing asynchronous activities. You also did well for your Summative 1 which you can be pleased about. At times, you could participate slightly more in class discussions, though when you contribute what you have to say is always valuable and valid. Overall, you can be proud of your efforts this term.

What I recommend now is that you keep on track for Summative 2, by getting started on making the video essay as soon as possible and manage your time well. If you use your time well, you are capable of getting an excellent grade as long as you make sure to engage with theoretical and analytical aspects of the module, and do some appropriate research/reading. If necessary, feel free to reach out to me for extra help."
Green,"You did well in improving your Summative 1 result in the resit, so well done for that. Your Formative 2 showed promise and something to work from for your Summative 2, which is a good thing. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Green,"You are participating well in all your live sessions and are a pleasure to have in the class. Continue to show the same enthusiasm and commitment moving forwards to get a good AES grade. Your participation in AES Online tasks has been very good, and I hope that you feel you are benefiting from this. Regarding skills, you are making excellent progress with listening and have done well in AES Online tasks, in-class tasks and in the listening exams we have done but should keep working at writing by using those academic conventions we have discussed in class and incorporating some techniques seen on AES Online to structure and organize your ideas. Overall though you should be pleased with your progress."
Amber,"You have made a good start in Literature - well done. You have engaged with class discussions and particularly group work, and have therefore been rewarded with a good assignment mark. You still have some work to do to reach the threshold for progression, but if you carry on working hard, you should be able to build on the work you have done in the first term. You should focus on being more vocal in class and improving the quality of your written work - and we will discuss the latter in your tutorial."
Amber,"Ali's submission for the Formative Assessment 1, as well as his class engagement and his homework submissions, have shown good knowledge and understanding of the content covered so far and improving research and writing skills. He is very conscientious and always on time with his submissions. His class contributions are very insightful and valuable, and they have often sparked a good discussion. I particularly appreciate the confidence with which he engages with new topics and the critical distance he maintains from them."
Green,"Syed is a committed student who contributes positively to class discussions and is also very good at asking questions, which helps considerably with learning.

His writing is of a good standard and, providing he takes note of the feedback he has received for his formative assignment, he will continue to improve. It was encouraging that his written work drew on academic sources that he had found independently. This points to scholarly engagement 

As is the case with all the students in the group, Syed needs to become familiar with the academic conventions, in particular the Harvard referencing system."
Green,"You are responsive to feedback, and you have made good progress in several areas of your academic study over the two terms at RHISC. You achieved a score of 70% in the summative writing exam, which sets you on the right path towards achieving 70% in AES Writing Skills as required by Royal Holloway. However, more improvement is needed in terms of your reading and research skills, as demonstrated in CW1 where your score was below 40%. Ali, you should complete the independent study tasks available on the AES Online platform every week and maintain a high level of performance for the remaining part of the course."
Green,"You have done well in Literature: both your Summative 1 and Formative 2 were strong results showing what you are capable of, so well done. This gives you an excellent foundation for your Summative 2. In class, your participation is measured but apposite and relevant. Generally speaking, you engage well asynchronously too. Therefore, there is a lot to be pleased with here. All in all, you should be pleased and aim to carry this momentum through into the final section of the course."
Green,"Ali's resit submission for the Summative Assessment 1 showed very good research and analytical skills. It also reflected very well the high quality of his class contributions and the knowledge, understanding and critical skills he has acquired in the last months. I recommend that he allocates enough time for research for the Summative Assessment 2 and generally that he focuses exclusively on the final assessments in the next weeks."
Green,"Your Summative 1 result was very good and in the short time I've taught you, your class contributions have also been strong and appreciated. 
You have already started work on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Your participation in AES Online tasks and other online activities such as the Flipgrid has been very good, and I hope that you feel you are benefitting from this. One area to work on is writing. Though it is generally good, to make it even better keep working on those academic conventions we have discussed in class and try to incorporate some of the techniques seen on AES Online to structure and organize your ideas. Keep working at including evidence to support your arguments."
Green,"You have shown a mature and dedicated attitude to your studies in the Literature module, making an impressive start - well done. You have readily contributed in class discussions and in group work, meaning that you have done well in your first assignment. This gives you a solid foundation for your summative work next term. Overall, you should be very pleased with your term's work."
Green,"You have had a very good term, engaging with the material well, consistently doing the homework in time, and contributing well during class discussions and in small groups. Well done and please keep this up. Your formative grade was good, but with a bit more practice and revision, I believe you can do even better. Just try to use the upcoming weeks to revise the terminology of film codes & conventions. We also will discuss how to improve your analysis skills in our upcoming tutorial."
Green,"Charlotte is an able and engaged student who contributes extremely positively to online class with interesting comments and questions.

Her written work is of a very promising standard, and she will continue to improve, providing that she takes note of the feedback provided. With greater attention to detail and criticality, her grades will continue to improve.

As is the case for all the students, Charlotte needs to become fully conversant with Harvard referencing."
Green,"You are responsive to feedback, and you build positive relationships with your peers and tutors. You achieved a score of 68% in the summative writing exam, and you have made noticeable progress in terms of your speaking skills, as demonstrated in summative speaking assessment where you were awarded a mark of 76%. You should continue to work on improving your academic writing skills with the use of Mock Exams as well as independent study tasks available on the AES platform every week."
Green,"You have shown yourself to be a conscientious and devoted student in Literature and this has started to pay dividends. Gradually your marks are improving assignment by assignment - well done. You are therefore in a very strong position for Summative 2, with an excellent Formative 2 behind you. Your engagement in class shows how well you are working more generally - you participate in groups and in class discussion, and this is on top of excellent asynchronous engagement. All in all, there is plenty to be pleased about here - well done and keep it up!"
Green,"You have continually been an engaged and positive student, contributing frequently and constructively in class, and always completing the asynchronous activities in time. You can be proud of your efforts and hard work this term, and of your good result in S1.

What I recommend now is that you keep on track for Summative 2 by getting started on making the video essay and managing your time accordingly. Remember to organise time for research and reading so that you can demonstrate analytical and critical thinking for your S2 video essay, as if you do so you should be in line for a very good grade."
Green,"Your Summative 1 result was very good and in the short time I've taught term 3, your class contributions have also been strong and appreciated. 
You have already started work on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Your participation in AES Online tasks and other online activities such as the Flipgrid has been very good, and I hope that you feel you are benefitting from this. You are doing well across the board, with speaking, listening, and reading. Keep up the good work."
Green,"You have made an excellent start to the course, as shown with your formative assignment mark, which is the result of a term's hard work - so well done. In groups, you work very well, which is to be commended. However, in class discussions, you are far more reticent: this is undoubtedly a point for you to work on as the points you do make are considered and apposite. It would be good to hear more from you. All in all, you should be very pleased with your term's work."
Green,"You have had a very good term, engaging with the material well, consistently doing the homework in time, and this was reflected in your excellent formative grade. Clearly, film is something you are both very enthusiastic about and very knowledgeable about --- your level of film & film history awareness is extremely impressive and a pleasure to behold. I am confident that this will keep you in excellent stead for your upcoming summative, so just keep up your current levels of hard work and motivation, and feel free to reach out to me at any time if you ever want to reach further than the level of film studies in this course."
Green,"Alina has written a very promising formative assignment which suggests that she has the potential to achieve a very high grade on this module. Her writing is of a high standard, and she has clearly fully understood and engaged with the concepts and theories covered so far on the module.

Alina should now focus on becoming fully conversant with academic conventions, such as including sources in her work and providing a list of references that are consistent with Harvard. 

Alina makes valuable contributions to class discussions and I would encourage her to do this more often."
Green,"You express your ideas clearly, both verbally and in writing. What is more, you can make a logical and persuasive argument. During group work in breakout rooms, you will do what is required and keep the group on task. You make group collaboration easy and straightforward as you offer constructive suggestions to peers to enhance their work. You are well on your way to achieving the required progression mark of 70% in Writing Skills, as you achieved a score of 82% in the summative writing exam. You need to ensure that you maintain your performance and participation in AES classes at a high level for the remaining part of the course."
Green,"You are clearly a very dedicated student. After something of hiccough with Summative 1, your Summative 1 Resit has put you firmly back on track - well done. Your Formative 2, however, was not quite as strong, so you need to keep an eye on ways you can improve this for your Summative 2 as we come to this part of the course. In class, you participate regularly and meaningfully, and you engage with the asynchronous work well. All in all, you should be very pleased with the work you have done."
Green,"You have continued to work well this term. Your Summative 1 was especially impressive and you can be proud of your efforts there. As we have transitioned from film to media, and despite occasional connection issues, you have remained engaged and regularly doing the asynchronous activities. Well done for the commitment you have shown.

What I recommend now is that you keep on track for Summative 2, by revising the relevant topics, and get started on making the video essay. You are capable of getting an excellent grade as long as you make sure to engage with theoretical and analytical aspects of the module, and do some appropriate research/reading."
Green,"Your Summative 1 result was very good and your Formative 2 showed a lot of promise. You have already started work on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing and puts you in a good position.

Amber,"Shahla has been making good progress so far on the course. She contributes well during class and has been engaging with the online content for AES. What she now needs to do is put the skills she is learning online into practice in her writing and seminar participation, focussing in particular on essay structure, paraphrasing and use of correct referencing in her work."
Green,Shahla is a very good student. Her attendance is good and she is very engaged in classes. She is always one of the first students to offer answers to questions and sometimes asks interesting questions. She also participates well in class discussions. Shahla has a lot of energy and her attitude to the class is a positive influence on the whole group.
Green,"Teaching you is a pleasure. You show significant interest in the class, making notes and participating in group discussion. You always involved during class time. To secure good grades, you need to concentrate and continue actively finishing all the asynchronous activities on Moodle,  identify and make a note of the subject-specific key terms from Kortex textbook and while doing independent reading.  Keep up your work and continue doing it, you can attain the best score and progress."
Green,
Amber,"You are participating well in all your live sessions and are a pleasure to have in the class. Continue to show the same enthusiasm and commitment moving forwards to get a good AES grade. Your participation in AES Online tasks and other online activities such as the Flipgrid has been very good, and I hope that you feel you are benefitting from this. Keep up the good work. Keep working on your speaking. Generally, it is good, though there are some things you could do to improve it. For seminars, make sure you are participating actively and using some language and techniques covered on AES Online and in-class to structure and extend your contributions. Overall a good effort, though keep working hard over the next term."
Amber,"Shahla remains a very positive student and brings a positive energy to every class. She appears engaged and shows good understanding in class, however her formative 1 result was somewhat disappointing. I will be discussing the feedback with Shahla and I am confident that she will approach the feedback positively and improve her marks going forward."
Green,"You're a lively person with a pleasing personality. I enjoy having you in my class. You show significant interest during class time and demonstrate a sound knowledge of the subject. Your recent summative assessment score is 70%.  You have strong potential to increase your score further, as evidenced by your performance in your assessment. However, you need to answer forum questions on time and do some independent reading from reputable sources as outlined in the module handbook. These steps will ensure your success in the course."
Amber,"Shahla is a frequent and excellent contributor to class discussions. With regard to her written work, she needs to work on responding more directly to the questions that are being asked and to write in an academic style in which paragraphs logically follow on from one another. 
I have the impression that Shahla has a very good grasp of the concepts and theories, but needs to improve her ability to convey this in her writing. Similar to the other students, I would recommend that Shahla reads more extensively and that she becomes familiar with academic conventions, such as referencing."
Amber,"You are a polite and respectful student who consistently demonstrates consideration for her peers and tutors. You have demonstrated some improvement regarding participation in synchronous sessions and group activities. I encourage you to approach all subjects and problems with a positive attitude. Establishing a consistent study and homework routine must become one of your main goals. You have made some progress in terms of your speaking skills as demonstrated in Summative Speaking Assessment (70%). However, your listening skills and research skills require further improvement as your scores were below 40% in both - summative listening exam and CW1. Therefore, it is recommended that you study independently, using resources available on AES Online. You should complete Mock Exams on WISEflow and you need to re-sit CW1 Source Report. If you continue to work on your academic skills development, you should increase your chance of progression to your chosen UG course at RHUL."
Amber,"Shahla brings a great deal of positive energy to class. She is probably the student that contributes the most to class discussions and activities and this is great to see. However, her summative 1 result was a little disappointing and she did not submit a formative for the second assignment. I remain optimistic about Shahla's future progress, but she needs to remain focussed and put all of her energy into completing the course successfully."
Green,"Having only taken over IFY Economics classes this week I cannot comment on past performance. I can see that you had green for your last RPAG, so you must have done well. However, I would like to stress how important it is for you to aim to achieve your best, so for the upcoming Summative 2 assignment, my advice is that you must place strong determination to succeed."
Amber,"While in the short time I've taught you, your class contributions have also been strong and appreciated, your Summative 1 result was slightly disappointing. I believe you can do better if you follow the feedback you have previously received, especially in terms of how to use secondary literature appropriately.

Furthermore, you have failed to submit a Formative 2. This leaves me slightly worried as you have not had the chance to practice writing a sociology essay. Please make sure to make the most of the time you have left and try to send me a draft in time for our individual tutorial."

Amber,Hussein participates and contributes to class activities. In coming weeks I would like him to be more consistent in submitting homework tasks and also increase his engagement with the on-line English platform as this will help me monitor his progress and provide feedback.
Green,"You have made a good start in Literature - well done. In particular, you work well in groups, and you have shown yourself to be organised and dedicated in your approach to your asynchronous work. It would now be good to see you expand this approach (and your confidence) to class discussions as you are definitely ready to take on a bigger role here. Overall, however, you should be pleased with a good start."
Amber,"Hussain has shown a lot of interest in and engagement with this course. He has completed his class, homework and asynchronous activities on time and his contributions to the class discussions have been insightful and valuable. He is conscientious and hard-working."
Amber,"Hussain has made a good start to this module. When he makes contributions to the groups, these are always useful. I would encourage Hussain to be more active in the group sessions and to make more contributions"
Amber,"Hussain’s has performed reasonably in his first set of mock exams, and reached his progression of 50% in reading, writing and speaking; however he did not reach progression of 40% for his listening. In order to achieve overall progression of 60% he needs to further work on all skills for the coming summative exams. I strongly recommend that he takes advantage of the reading, writing and listening exam practices that are on the online English platform to help him prepare, and seek further support from her AES tutor -- by doing so I believe he will achieve progression."
Amber,"You are evidently working hard in Literature and this is plain to see through considered contributions in class. You also make a clear effort to work hard in group work, which shows your dedication to the subject, so well done. Unfortunately you did not do so well in your assignment. However, you have the right attitude to be able to turn this around if you take my feedback on board and listen carefully to what is required. All in all, there is cause for optimism."
Amber,"Hussain's submission for the Formative Assessment 1, as well as his class engagement and homework submissions, have shown good knowledge and understanding of the content covered so far and improving research and writing skills. He is very conscientious and always on time with his submissions. His class contributions are very insightful and valuable."
Amber,"Hussain continues to make interesting contributions to class discussions. I believe he has a good understanding of the key concepts and theories on the module. 

Hussain needs to work on improving the clarity of his written assignments, ensuring that these are well structured in logical paragraphs that are divided into short and coherent sentences. Similar to the other students, I would recommend that Hussain reads academic texts that he can use as sources in his written work, and that he becomes familiar with academic conventions, for example, referencing."
Amber,"Hussein has been working diligently throughout the year, and it has truly paid off as his summative results show that he is on the way to meeting progression. As he needs 70% in writing, to help him prepare for the upcoming AES final exams I have already strongly recommended the reading and writing booklet as a resource that will best help him improve. In addition, he should also focus on his CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve his end goal."
Amber,"You are very close to achieving the result you need for progression: continued hard work will hopefully see you improve further. You are clearly working hard in the module and this has led to good results for both Summative 1 and Formative 2, giving you a solid foundation for your final Summative 2. Your participation in class is generally good, though could be further improved. Your asynchronous work is consistent too - well done. All in all, there is plenty to be pleased about, so carry on working hard with an eye on progression."
Amber,"Hussain's submission for the Summative Assessment 1 showed good progress in terms of subject-specific research and analytical skills. He remains very conscientious and works hard to improve his knowledge, understanding and writing skills. Unfortunately, the latter is where he needs to work harder. With the support of the AES team in the last months, the quality of writing has improved a lot but there is still a need for more into this."
Green,"You did well in improving your Summative 1 result in the resit, so well done for that. Your Formative 2 showed a lot of promise and you have clearly already started work on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Green,Elaf is a conscientious and motivated student who contributes well to class discussion and group activities. She engages with the on-line English platform and consistently submits her homework  every week which enables me to both monitor her progress and provide appropriate feedback - keep up the good work.
Green,"You have made a promising start in Literature - well done. You have shown yourself to be a committed and dedicated student, completing work on time and to a high standard. In class, you contribute to group discussions and are engaged in classwork. However, you could improve in taking a greater role in class discussion, where you can be somewhat reticent. Try and improve this, perhaps by using the chat box, if you are lacking confidence."
Amber,"Elaf has been very engaged with this course and completed the class, homework and asynchronous activities in a timely manner. She is very conscientious and hard-working. Her contributions to the class discussions have been very insightful and valuable."
Green,"A very promising start by  organised student who completes work regularly
Elaf should try to contribute to discussions more often."
Green,"Elaf has performed very well in her first set of mock exams, particularly in her reading, listening and speaking. I have no doubt that as long as she continues with her current performance she will do well in the upcoming summative exams. Her writing was below 60%, but it is one area that can be further worked, and one that I believe she can achieve an even higher score in providing she takes on board and applies the feedback. I recommend completing 1 or 2 writing exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare and seek feedback from her AES tutor."
Green,"You have made a good start in Literature, showing yourself to be a dedicated and committed student - well done. You work well in groups and contribute regularly in class discussions, something which has improved noticeably in recent weeks. All of this has led to a very good formative result, putting you in a good place for your summative work next term. All in all, you can be very pleased with your first term's work in Literature."
Amber,"Even though Elaf's submission for the Formative 1 was rather weak, she has shown a lot of commitment to improve her knowledge, understanding, writing and research skills. Elaf is very conscientious and hardworking. She has always submitted her homework and asynchronous activities on time and has been very engaged in the class discussions. I particularly appreciate her contributions to the class discussions and activities which I find insightful, valuable and show independent thinking."
Green,"Elaf is an able student who is making promising progress.

Her written work is quite good, but I would strongly recommend that she uses up her word count when she writes assignments. This will enable her to develop her ideas more strongly and to apply greater criticality to her work, which will improve its quality significantly.

As is the case with the other students, Elaf needs to become fully conversant with Harvard referencing."
Green,"Elaf possesses strong language skills which she has been able to apply well to the AES exams. Her results to date are very good to outstanding. She has demonstrated strong critical thinking skills and this will put her in good stead for her university studies. For CW1 I believe she would have scored an even higher grade if she had invested a little more time in the preparation. In addition, she should focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result."
Amber,"Your Summative 1 result was very good - well done. Your Formative 2 was slightly weaker, hence the amber grading here. However, with hard work there is no reason why this shouldn't translate into the mark you need for progression. You are clearly a dedicated student - so much is clear from the way in which you engage in class and the time you devote to your asynchronous work. All in all, there is much to be pleased with; keep this up for final success."
Amber,"Elaf's resit submission for the Summative Assessment 1 showed very good progress in terms of knowledge and understanding, research and analytical skills. Elaf has remained very conscientious and hardworking and this was reflected in the improved quality of the assignments and assessments. I recommend that she focuses exclusively on the final assessments in the following weeks and allocates enough time for all of them."
Green,"Your Summative 1 result was very good and your Formative 2 showed promise. You have clearly already made good progress on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing and puts you in a strong position to keep working towards an excellent final grade. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Amber,"Bonnie is capable of progressing from the course, but seems to struggle in her writing. It is essential that she uses the opportunities presented to practice her writing structure, but also learns to take more care to cut out some of the elementary grammar errors, which she has a tendency to make in written assignments"
Green,Roubing has done well in the IB summative 1. She is committed to her studies and has a very good attendance record. She participates in class and shows her interest in her studies.
Amber,"Ruobing started off quite shy but, now she participates in class. Her work just needs some improvement to ensure she passes. She needs to ensure she answers all questions asked."
Green,"Ruobing started off quite shy but, now she participates in class and completes her work to a good standard."
Amber,"Roubing attends all her classes  and she has achieved a very good mark in her QM summative 1 assessment.
She is hardworking and shows her zeal to excel in her studies. Keep up the good work."
Green,"Bonnie achieved a very good result in her reading exam and also produced a strong first exam performance in listening. She now needs to focus on her writing, and it is important that she revises sentence structure and cohesion. I will also provide plenty of opportunities to practice in the second half of the course."
Green,"Ruobing is working hard, and she is determined to achieve good grades. She makes an attempt to participate in class discussion more, and she has very good attendance.  No FDE assignments have been completed so far, and so I could not comment on grades."
Amber,"Ruobing gets on with the work and does what is expected of her. My advice to her would be to work on ensuring she is also working hard outside of class to ensure she is stretched and extending her knowledge and understanding. This can be achieved through secondary reading based on what has been learnt in lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway. When this begins to show in class, through your verbal and written contributions, this will also help move Ruobing from amber to green."
Amber,"Ruobing is a positive student who shows good engagement in class. She leaves her camera on for the entire class which is good for her studies. She has the confidence to attempt to answer questions which is good, but at times her understanding needs to be developed a little further. I recommend that she takes notes in class and perhaps does some reading of the related material in the book."
Amber,"Ruobing, your attendance and class engagement have been good. However, until you were prompted during the third week, your moodle engagement was not good enough. Keep up this new enthusiasm of accessing and utilising your learning materials.

Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."
Green,
Green,Ruobing is improving in her work as reflected in the good mark she gained for FDE S1. I expect that she will keep up this standard for her S2.
Amber,
Amber,"Ruobing is trying hard. She has scored a reasonably good mark for IB S2. If she can aim to increase her performance in her current studies, then she can gain quite a good performance overall."
Green,

My major concern at the moment is with his internet connection, which can at times be poor, and I think it is important that a better internet solution be looked into."

Amber,"Yuliang is a quiet student. He is very good at keeping his camera on in class and this is a good first step in increasing his engagement. I would suggest that he increases his participation in class discussions. He is able to answer questions when asked directly, but his understanding needs to be developed further if he is going to succeed on the course."
Amber,"Yuliang, your attendance and moodle engagement have been good, but you need to improve on your class engagement as this will help you to sharpen your English language skills and improve your confidence. One way to do this is to ensure that seminar worksheet homework is completed before you attend the seminar.
 Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."

This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Amber,"Haoze is a very good student. Whilst he is generally quiet he shows good engagement throughout the class and will often answer questions wiithout prompting. His understanding still needs to develop, but he is doing the right things to develop himself and this is positive for his success in the future."
Amber,"Haoze, you have been punctual at lectures and seminars and accessed your moodle page frequently. However, you need to improve on your contribution during seminars  because this is where you have the opportunity to sharpen your English-speaking skills and also seek clarification on any difficult areas.
As you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."

Green,Cheuk is an excellent student who has commendable attendance. He managed to score 87% in SA1. He can improve his participation in the class. He puts in a very good level of effort into his studies and should be able to progress into RHUL successfully.
Amber,"Riley is one of our brightest students and I am happy to see that he is actively engaged with class activities. He should join the discussions and take the chance to explain and ask questions from his friends/classmates and his tutor during the online session. She should not feel shy to speak up and ask questions when he has one.   

He has demonstrated an excellent level of performance in the module and I am happy to confirm a high level of attendance in his programming modules. Well done Riley."
Green,"Riley is one of our brightest students, and I am happy to see that he is actively involved in group discussions, and in-class tasks. 

I like to hear more from him during the sessions. He should not feel shy to communicate his ideas, solutions during the session.

I have no doubt that as long as she continues with her current performance she will do well in the upcoming summative exams. Her writing, already very good, is one area that can be further worked on, and one that I believe she can achieve an even higher score in. I recommend completing 1 or 2 writing exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare."
Green,"From the beginning of the course, you have shown yourself to be a dedicated and articulate student. This was apparent in your first formative assignment and is often clear in your contributions in class, which are considered and meaningful. You also work well in groups which is to be commended. Keep up the good work! You should be pleased with your first term's work in Literature."
Green,"Excellent class engagement. 77% F1 - very detailed understanding of the topic. Always answers questions well. In the future, please spend time reviewing class material from previous weeks to jog your memory."
Green,Hana is an engaged student who makes interesting contributions. I would encourage her to speak out more. Hana's written work is of a good standard that demonstrates her understanding of the key concepts and theories. Her work will be enhanced by reading academic texts which she can use as sources in her writing. This will enable her to develop greater depth and more criticality in her writing.
Green,Hana possesses strong language skills which she has been able to apply well to the AES exams and coursework. Her results to date are very good to outstanding. She has demonstrated strong critical thinking skills and this will put her in good stead for her university studies. I believe that Hana will do well in the remaining summative exams and achieve progression.
Green,"You did well in your Summative 1 and nearly as well in your Formative 2, so you should be pleased. It would be good to see you strive for the next level in your written work: we have spoken about what you need to do in order to achieve this and your Summative 2 is the perfect time. In class, your engagement is generally very good, though this is not always matched with your asynchronous work, which is something to keep an eye on. All in all, though, you should be pleased with the work you have done."
Green,"S1 was fantastic. Well done! Very diligent student who does all homework and pays a lot of attention in class and actively participates in group discussion.
F2 mark was 87%, great job."
Green,"Your Summative 1 result was very good and in the short time I've taught you, your class contributions have also been strong and appreciated. 
Your Formative 2 showed a lot of promise and you have clearly already started work on your Summative 2, which is a very good thing. Keep working on your S2 draft, applying the feedback that I left you, and make sure you revise any conceptual and theoretical material that you need to from the module."

Green,"After a little while taken to settle, your work in Literature this term has been excellent. This has been most clearly demonstrated in your assignment mark, which is very good indeed - well done. You have shown, both in class and in conversation outside, that you are engaging with the texts in a close and intellectual way and your interpretations are often thought-provoking and original. You work well in groups and contribute in class. Carry on with this pattern of work in order to be successful in the next part of the course. You should also start to engage with the additional materials on Moodle so that you can gain a deeper understanding of some of the texts we are studying."
Green,"Despite the inherent difficulties of studying online during a global pandemic, you have had a successful first semester on the Film and Media module.

You have worked hard this semester. Your contributions in the seminars were always appreciated. The seminars were greatly improved by having the class join in and work together!  You received a good grade for your very creative formative assessment, and you also had excellent attendance, which means that you are currently on track to progress and that you should continue to do well in the next semester as long as you continue to work hard and maintain this level of commitment.

I am sure that you will do well in 2021!"
Green,"Mario's attendance has been excellence. He consistently participates and makes valuable contributions in class. He is a conscientious student and this is reflected also in his assessment' result. His assessment was actually very good/excellent, but he was late to submit and thus lost 10 percentage marks. Despite this, he should not face any issues with progressing."

Green,Mario is a very strong member of a good AES group. His insightful comments and willingness to get involved in discussions and group work show me that he would be an excellent addition to any undergraduate cohort.
Amber,"You continue to be a conscientious and engaged student. Your group work, as well as your contributions to class discussions, is thoughtful and considered. This means you often make perceptive and insightful points. I know that your Formative assignment mark is of some concern to you (the reason for your 'amber' here) - especially after such an excellent Summative mark - but we will discuss this further in your tutorial, as well as strategies to help you improve your work for your final summative assignment next term. Overall, you should be pleased with your work this term."
Green,"You have had a very good term in film & media, especially demonstrated by your excellent score in the recent formative assessment. In class, you are consistently making insightful and thought-provoking contributions to discussions. All this should keep you in good stead for the written components of the upcoming summative portfolio. Please try to use the break to think of potential creative ideas to start planning your storyboard as well. All in all, you have shown yourself to be a motivated, diligent and talented student, and you can be proud of your hard work this term. Pleaes keep it up."
Green,"You have had a very good term, showcasing impressive conscientiousness, critical ability and willingness to learn. Your contributions in class are consistently excellent and demonstrate your thinking and insight. You have also consistently done the homework to a very good standard. I do know that you were slightly disappointed with both your summative and formative grades, which also shows your determination to keep improving --- a positive trait. Let's discuss in a tutorial how you can continue to improve at your essay writing, so that with your current level of hard work and motivation you will be able to do even better for the final summative. All in all, though, you should be very proud of a great term, so please keep up the fantastic work."

Green,"From the start of the year, you have demonstrated that you are an able and committed student, a trend which has continued all term. You have done well in your assignment, though perhaps not as well as you could have done - and we will discuss this in your tutorial, including strategies to help you improve for your summative. Meanwhile, your group work is excellent. On occasion you can be a touch reticent in class; keep an eye on that, and think about engaging with the additional materials on Moodle to help you gain a deeper understanding of the texts we are studying."
Green,"You have made a very promising start in Music. You are clearly a highly committed and engaged student and in class, you participate in a meaningful and considered way. Your assignment mark was very good, but there is definitely room for improvement as you are a very capable student, and we will discuss this in your tutorial, talking specifically about what you can do to ensure that you incorporate secondary literature into your work. Overall, however, you should be pleased with an excellent term's work."
Green,"Sophia's record of attendance has been excellent. She consistently participates in class while she is a very conscientious student, reflected also in the result of her Formative assignment. While her assessment was very good, I believe Sophia is able of performing much better than this and most definitely has the capabilities to achieve better marks."

Green,"Your work in Literature this term has been dedicated and considered - well done. As a result, you have two excellent assignment results, especially your Summative 1. We will discuss strategies for your final summative assignment when we meet to discuss your last formative in your tutorial and this will help you understand what you need to do to improve. However, you have an excellent foundation to build on for progression and overall you should be very pleased indeed."
Green,"From the start of the course you have been both dedicated and conscientious in Music and this is starting to pay dividends. You have paid careful attention to feedback meaning you submitted a strong Summative 1 and did well in Formative 2, so are on track to do well overall in the module if you carry on working hard. In class the results of this dedication are plain to see with your apposite and meaningful contributions. All in all, you should be pleased with an excellent term's work in Music."
Green,"Overall you have had a very good term. I do know you were slightly disappointed with your Summative 1, but you picked yourself up from this and worked harder to do much better in Formative 2. Your grade there holds a lot of promise for your upcoming final summative. In class, you make regular and excellent contributions, and ask pertinent questions, which is always good to see. Do also try to keep on top of the homework and asynchronous activities, which will continue to enhance your sociological knowledge for your written assessments. Overall, you have worked very hard this term and should be proud of your work, please keep it up."

However, his classroom performance has been consistently good, and he appears to be engaged with the course as a whole."
Green,"Chengcai has a very good attendance record, and he participates in class discussion. He gained a fairly good mark for IB summative 1, and he can aim to work harder and do better the next time round."
Amber,Chengcai is getting more involved in seminars and there has been some improvement in his work too. He needs to ensure he fully understands the questions asked.
Green,Chengcai is getting more involved in seminars and there has been some improvement in his work too.

He is hardworking and shows his zeal to succeed in his studies."
Green,"Chengcai has done well in the first part of the course and achieved a good result in the reading exam. Unfortunately, the listening and writing results were not as good and he will now need to focus on scoring at least over 50% in the next exams. I will provide him with plenty of opportunities to practice in class but would hope that he does some practice on his own as well.

Green,"Chengcai is a good student. Always gets involved in seminars and workshop, he completes his work to a high standard. Now, my advice would be for Chengcai to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Amber,"Chengcai is a very quiet student. He does not participate in class discussions, ask questions or answer questions. Chengcai needs to increase his engagement in classroom activities to improve his chances of success going forward. I also suggest that he keeps his camera on for the whole class to help his engagement."
Amber,"Chengcai, your attendance and moodle engagement have been good, but you need to improve on your class engagement as this will help you to sharpen your English language skills and improve your confidence. 
 Additionally, as you prepare to submit your summative assessments, do take note of the guidance provided and avoid losing marks through late submissions and high similarity."

Green,"Yahia has demonstrated a good level of performance and class engagement over the past few weeks, and I am happy to hear from him with potential suggestions for improvement in the module. I am confident that if he continues to work hard, attends his online classes and aims to complete all assignment and class activities, he should on track to pass the module and contribute to his GPA requirement. 
Keep up the hard work, Yahia."
Green,"Yehia has a good understanding of the subject. He managed to score 88% in SA1. He has a positive attitude when attending classes. However, Yehia needs to work on his attendance and not miss classes. He has SA2 and SA3 coming up which will require him to study hard and attend the classes to prepare well for the assessments."
Amber,"Yehia seems to be making good progress with the module. He has missed few of his classes in the recent weeks and this had an impact on his performance on his third summative assessment. He should take his studies very serious and aim to attend all remaining sessions, review the examples and exercises after each session and practice with programming without checking solutions from notes. He can evaluate his work once he is confident that he has answered all parts of a question. Yahia has an attendance level of 79% and he should aim to attend all remaining sessions of the module. 
Yahia should reflect on his study plans and he should reflect on his study plans to assure he is allocating enough hours for practice with programming and assessment preparation."
Amber,"Yahia engages with class activities, and he has a positive attitude towards his studies. He needs to improve his organisational skills and prepare for assessments ahead of the time. He should practice with practical coding questions. He has demonstrated good level of problem-solving and logical thinking in solving problems, however, he has to implement his solutions in PyCharm to improve his technical skills in working with the PyCharm IDE. 
I am sure he can catch up with the material and meet his progression requirements if he works hard and follows instructions in class. His attendance rate in the module is about 68% which is a cause of concern, and he should aim to attend all the remaining sessions."
Green,"Yehia has done well in the S1 (100%). Although he can improve his attendance for this module. However, he participates actively in each session and needs to keep up the good work."
Green,Well done. You have passed the module and met your progression requirements.
Green,Well done on successfully passing the module. Keep up the good work in the next semester.
Green,"You seem to be making some progress with the module. You are active in class, and you have demonstrated a good level of engagement in class activities. You ask questions where you have one, which is great. 

Please keep up the hard work and continue to practice with examples and exercises in notes. Please note that assessment is not the idea time to practice and ask questions how to carry out certain techniques. It is best to practice and learn such techniques in preparation for your assessment and as part of your learning process. Please continue wo to work hard and review your study plans to allow more time for assessment preparation and practising with Java programming."
Green,"Well done, You have passed and met your progression requirements. You may wish to review and practice with examples and exercises from IY1_OOP I to improve your performance in IY1_OOP II."
Amber,"It seems like you are making some progress in the module. Your score at the second summative assessment is a cause of concern, and you should review your study plans to allow more time for practising with Python programming. Please review the exercises and examples at the end of each session and aim to complete them on your own without replicating the answers from class notes or tutor's solutions. Only refer to solutions if you attempted the question for 10-15 minutes and if you have not managed to make any progress, you can check the solutions to understand how we have solved the problem. I am happy that you are active in class, and you seem to have improved your level of attendance. Please continue to attend all your remaining sessions and engage with class activities."

My additional advice would simply be to ensure that over this Christmas period, the student ensures they are revising what they have learnt in the first half of semester 1 and are prepared to apply their knowledge more thoroughly to the work the second half of semester 1. Please consult the Moodle pages of your modules regularly and evenly."

Green,Alyazia is a conscientious student who contributes well to class discussion and group activities. She is engaging with the on-line English platform and is consistently submitting her homework which enables me to both monitor her progress and provide appropriate feedback - keep up the good work.
Green,
Green,
Green,
Green,"Alyazia has performed very well in her first set of mock exams, particularly in her reading, listening and speaking. I have no doubt that as long as she continues with her current performance she will do well in the upcoming summative exams. Her writing, already very good, is one area that can be further worked on, and one that I believe she can achieve an even higher score in. I recommend completing 1 or 2 writing exam practices that are on the online English platform to help her prepare and seek feedback from her AES tutor."
Green,"Your attendance for applied maths is very good. you always participate in class discussions and solve the questions given by your tutor and always finish your homework which resulted in your F1 grade is 75%. Well done! Although based on your work, I am sure you could achieve even higher grades. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the Formative 2 and summative 1."
Green,"Your attendance for physics is very good. You always participate in the class discussions and solve the questions given by your tutor and finish your homework. Your F1 was 62%, which is acceptable for F1 since it was your first assessment, you are now more familiar with the way that the questions would come up in the exam and how to solve and write your answer. I recommend you to go through your notes and the Moodle and make yourself ready for the summative 1."
Green,Alyazia is an excellent student. She has a very good understanding of the subject. Her attendance and participation in the class are commendable. My advice would be for her to incorporate a proactive approach to her studies where she looks into the lecture notes beforehand and can achieve even better results. She will do very well in her upcoming summative assessment and will be able to progress to RH without much difficulty.
Green,"Alyazia possesses strong language skills which she has been able to apply well to the AES exams and coursework. Her results to date are very good to outstanding. She has demonstrated strong critical thinking skills and this will put her in good stead for her university studies. An area that could be improved upon further is her exam writing skills and providing she takes on the feedback I believe that Alyazia will be able to do well in the summative exam. I have recommended the reading and writing exam booklet as a resource that will best help her practice. In addition, she should focus on her CW 2 and 3 and seek the help necessary to achieve the required result."
Green,"Your attendance for applied maths is 100%, and you have always been engaged with the lesson. Your summative 1 is 89%, and now you only need to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation. So please continue attending your applied maths classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Green,"You have attended all your physics classes since the beginning of the year and always tried to understand what has been taught in the class by asking questions and participating in the class discussions. Your Summative 1 is 73%, and now it is time to focus on your research, poster preparation and presentation and continue attending your physics classes so that we can have one to ones about your poster before the presentation day."
Green,"Alyazia is consistent throughout her class participation, homework, and assessments. She has a good understanding of the subject. She needs to keep up with the effort to successfully complete this module. She managed to score 83% in formative 2."

Green,"Considering the issues that Kyaw Min has been experiencing over the last few months, I am delighted with his progress in the class. He is a valuable member of the group and is capable of very good results.
The area for Kyaw Min to focus on moving forward is seminars, as he lost marks in the first seminar assessment because he was too reliant on notes. In future, it is important to only use notes as reminders of the supporting evidence to back up the key points"
Green,"Kyaw Min is an outstanding student who works tremendously hard. His hard  work  is reflected in the results he achieved for the IB summative 1. He is ever so keen to learn and excel in his studies. Just keep up the good work. 
His attendance record is 100% for all lectures, seminars and workshops which just shows his strong commitment to succeed."

Green,"Kyaw is a very good student. Always gets involved in seminars and workshop, he completes his work to a high standard. Now, my advice would be for Kyaw to stretch himself by engaging in further reading on the back of lectures and seminars. This is the kind of practice strong students demonstrate and will prepare you well for when you transition to the department at Royal Holloway."
Green,Kyaw Min is a very good student who has developed his confidence already in the short time since the beginning of the module. He actively attempts to answer questions and participates in class discussions well. His answers to questions show good knowledge of the subject and his understanding is developing well. I am very optimistic about Kyaw Min's success going forward.
